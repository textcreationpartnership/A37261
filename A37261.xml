            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>THis following Discourse I Avouch to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true Evangelick Spirit in the Point, whereof it treats, and so according to the Analogy of Faith; I am assured therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Rule of Charity, that hopeth all Things; All other the <hi>Author's Discourses</hi> must needs carry the same <hi>Analogy</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> with it self: I do not say, but in the <hi>Pathos</hi> and vehemency of pressing Truth upon a popular Auditory, There may be what they call <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; an over weight on that side, whither the Torrent of Discourse runs: And hereunto the <hi>Speaker</hi>'s Propension and Byass of Thoughts most inclines. For what Serious and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Perswader does not suffer the same Inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Propension? That excellent Writer
<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Daille.</hi>
                     </note> of the <hi>Right use of the Fathers</hi> observes not only, but Apologizes the same thing for them; that in their warmths of Exhortation, they bent often the Stick to the contrary Extream. Now, God forbid, every Expression so straying, should be either Interpreted unto Heresy, or uncharitably turned into an Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let this therefore more weighed Treaty of Things and Declaration of the Writer's Judgment stand a Rule for Interpretation of all Popular Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. For herein, as more exactly weighed, and solemnly published; There is an Appeal to God, to his <hi>Churches,</hi> the <hi>Pastors, Teachers,</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:51088:3"/>even to the <hi>Rational World;</hi> and so as a kind so Oath; It ought to be an end of Strife; except some other Solemn and Avowed, Discourse either Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or Published, Counter-balanc'd it.</p>
                  <p>In this I observe nothing but what is manifested, as before God; so I cannot but hope to the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of all who are Spiritual. And if any others will be ignorant, let them so be.</p>
                  <p>It is my Judgment, that in the stating the Order of Nature between Conviction of Sin, leading the Saints to the Sight of the need of Christ, as to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it, and the Application to Christ. This Discourse grants too much to Conviction, of Sin, rather than too little, <hi>viz.</hi> That sight of Sin, need of Christ, must in Order of Nature needs be first. For why may not the need of Christ, and from thence a sight of Sin, rise as properly from those Grand Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Gospel, <hi>Christ died for all,</hi> viz. (Who Live and have their Lives given them.) Seeing from thence, it must needs be concluded, They were all Dead, as well as Sight of Sin, by and upon sense of our need of Christ, be from legal Convictions of Sin: For the Apostle so reasons, And why not as well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, if Christ died, Righteousness cannot be by the Law; for then Christ must have Died in vain, on which plainly follows in the sense of Sin in just Order; As seeing Righteousness cannot be by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Law, therefore we must Run to a Dying Jesus, from the sight of that condemning Law first. These therefore are Co equal, Co ordinate; and sure if any have the Preference, or Dignity, it is due to the Death of Christ, to be the Original, and to be in all these as the Pre eminent Source of Truth for the Divine Grace to produce in his Elect, sense of Sin, and deep Humiliation under it; we are all lost and undone in our selves by a Holy Law Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning for Sin; And God so loved the World, that whoever Believes shall not Perish, Christ died for the
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:51088:3"/>Chief of Sinners. Necessarily inserring. We are all in a perishing condition by reason of Sin. And God in the Varieties of his own Wisdom, makes use of the One, even as of the other, according to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Subjects he hath to work upon and the various Dispensations of Truth, he Concredits to his Ministers, whom he makes the Instruments of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; and to think to bind all to one Method, is to think to make weights, our selves, for the Wind, to hold it in our Fist, to cause it to blow when, and whence we list.</p>
                  <p>There is in Relation to the Author of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, great Thoughts of Heart, as well as Noises, concerning some unusual Impressions on his Hearers, call'd Fitts.</p>
                  <p>But that which I think all Persons concerned about them should first enquire and satisfy themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. What the success of his Ministry is in Turning Men from darkness to Light, from Satan to God Manifested in their Change, from a vain De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched meer earthly, to a holy serious heavenly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. For if this he really found in Conjunction with a preaching the <hi>Truth that is in Jesus,</hi> Matt. xii. 24. Two Things from our Lord's Vindication of himself, and his Ministry, will follow to Allay this Doubt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there can be no Argument taken from these Symptoms, As if God were displeased with a Ministry, to which he gives Testimony by that great and mighty Effect of Conversion and bringing home to himself. For this is the Work of God, giving Witness to the Ministry of his Servants; and such Ministry needs not Letters of Commendation to or from; for Converts are their Epistle, being the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle of Christ Ministred by such his Servants; and then such Permissions of Satan are to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either as Tryals on his Servants, of their <hi>Faith, Patience,</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> or for their <hi>Humiliation</hi> and
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:51088:4"/>
                     <hi>Self-Abasement,</hi> like the Apostle's <hi>Thorn in the Flesh a Messenger of Satan to buffet him.</hi> And they are in Judgment, and as a Snare upon them, who love not the Lord Jesus, nor his Gospel in Sincerity, while his own are more careful to Purify themselves, Watching and Praying, They may not fall into Temptation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There can be no Confederacy in such a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry with Satan's Kingdom; for then as our Lord argued, <hi>Satan must be divided against himself.</hi> And therefore a Caution lies here against imputing to Satan what is of God. For whatever holds out Christ high, and in his due Fxaltation, and is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bringing home Sinners to God, I look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a very dangerous Approach to that Sin, to Impute it to Satan.</p>
                  <p>There are other Things that are made Matters of scruple, and prejudice against the Ministry of the Author, of which I will not particularly speak, but give some general Intimations of Satisfaction, by laying down several Positions relating both to them and the approaching Kingdom of Christ, of general Truth, and seasonable to the Time and present Hour.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That whereas we are now so Jealous of the Highest Preaching the Highest Largest Grace of the Redemption of Christ; least it should bring in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Liberty, in this time of the Apostacy, wherein that <hi>New Song of the Redemption of Christ,</hi> Rev. v. is so much lost; That very Redemption in its mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us Kings and Priests to God, will be found to have all the Springs of Holiness in it; when that, as it were new Song, because so much lost, shall be Sung, learn'd by the 144000, and by them taught to the World itself; if that Doctrine of it be now truly Preach'd and Receiv'd, it can produce nothing but Holiness and Spirituality, in that Kingdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to appear. So that there is no reason to be
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:51088:4"/>Offended at the aspiring to it now, by any of the Servants of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That whereas it is thought, Miracles and Gifts of Healing among others, are quite ceased, because of the Canon of Scripture settled; there is indeed only an Interruption by the coming of the Apostacy, but that Power shall return with much greater Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy; we need neither therefore wonder so much if any such be vouchsafed, or on the other side, that it is not more High and Perfect, because the Time of the <hi>Apostacy,</hi> is not expired.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although Churches congregated by agreement, if but of Two or Three, to ask any Thing in Christ's Name, be the best Constitution at this time of any, and founded on that Charter, <hi>Matt.</hi> xviii. 19, 20. Yet such Churches are to take heed, they do not stand in the way of Christ's Kingdom, but give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to all Emotions of it by way of Redundance. For in his Kingdom all shall be moving to that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyris, that <hi>General Assembly and Church of the First Born.</hi> If any Flow therefore from any one of the Churches of Christ, Stream into another; seeing all should Work the Work of Christ, one even as the other; they should not be look'd upon as break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches, but as a gladsome Union and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of the same Streams, and the same pure River, making glad the City of God.</p>
                  <p>These Things I thought fit to Preface, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Prejudice, and that a way might be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Fulness of the Blessing of the Gospel,</hi> so far as Ministred in this following Discourse. To which End are my humble and earnest Prayers.</p>

                     <hi>Expositors</hi> say, In the first Clause, Christ is brought in speaking of himself, viz. <hi>They shall look upon me whom they have pierced.</hi> In the second Clause,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51088:6"/>God is brought in by the Prophet, as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Son, viz. <hi>And they shall mourn for him.</hi> However, all agree, that Christ is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by these little Pronouns (<hi>me</hi> and <hi>him.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>In this Chapter there are many Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Descriptions of the Glory to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Gospel-Days; especially of the fulness of that Glory towards the latter End of those Days.</p>
                  <p>Among manifold Prophesies which have an Aspect on that Glory, this in <hi>Ver.</hi> 10, is one, <hi>viz.</hi> That there will be then, a Great and Plentiful Effusion of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> This was partly accomplished at the Day of <hi>Pentecost:</hi> But it is yet to have a Greater Acomplishment towards the End of Times; which Glory the Souls of some of us earnestly long after.</p>
                  <p>There are abundance of Promises in the Old and New Testament, (which I shall not now stand to mention) which contain this Great, and Glorious Priviledge the Saints shall have at last, <hi>viz.</hi> A Wonderful pouring down of the Holy Spirit upon them; even such, (if not greater) than was at the Day of Pentecost; and there are in my Text, three Great Effects mentioned thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Spirit will be as <hi>a Spirit of Grace;</hi> whence it will follow, that all the Graces of the Spirit, shall be made vigorously to flourish in the Souls of the Godly then.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:51088:6"/> 2. He will <hi>be a Spirit of Supplication:</hi> A mighty Spirit of Prayer will come down upon the Godly then. The Godly will pray after such a rate and manner, that they themselves will be ashamed of their former Prayers. It will not then be a cold, dry repeating over of some Petitions, and a dead Form of Confession, and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, with a withered Formality of Praising;

<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> v. 9, 11, 12, 13.</note> together with a lively, hearty, zealous sounding forth the Praises of the Glory of his Free Grace. I know such manner of Praying, or that that looks like it, stumbles the present Generation. But when the Spirit is poured down from on high, it will be otherwise then.</p>
                  <p>This Observation I have made; that we may judge of a Man's Spirit, very much by his Prayer, and discern therein, whether he be then under the Teachings of the Spirit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51088:7"/>or no, whether he decays, or grows in his Soul; For a Man's Praying is very much the Pulse of his Soul. If a Man prays Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, Evangelically, with holy and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Boldness, through the Blood of Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, with great nearness to God, in Christ; you may conclude, that Soul is in a good Frame, and growing in Grace. But, if one Prays coldly, formally, and legally, with a Multitude of well-ordered Sentences, or a number of vain Repetitions, forced out with a meer natural Vehemency: you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Soul is in a poor, and withering Condition, has nothing of the Spirit of Prayer; and such a Praying will, one way or other, be to the spiritual Disadvantage of all the Godly that hear it. I have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been so cast down when I have heard some Pray, that I could not be lively in my Spirit some time after: But this is certain, where there is a Spirit of Prayer, or Praising poured upon any, all the Godly that are present will more or less feel it. But then also upon the pouring down of the Spirit, there will be a greater frequency in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Now a Man thinks himself a very strict Christian, if he Prays but twice a day; keeping to his set-times of Morning and Evening. But then the Godly shall Pray many times a day. If People stint themselves to so many times, and not above it, it will be very prone to degenerate into Formality.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:51088:7"/>
                  <p> Oh! that you that live in the midst of the Hurries and Vanities of <hi>London,</hi> would be often on your knees in your Closets, and they that have Families, in their Families too! and that whatever Concernment you meet about, you would begin with Prayer. Oh! that such a Spirit was poured down upon you! though it be far otherways now; I am persuaded e're long it will be thus with the Godly; when the Spirit is poured down from on high, they will be then for improving all Opportunities to go to the Throne of Grace; And when they have not Set-times for Prayer, yet their Hearts will be continually addressing themselves to the Father of Mercies in Christ Jesus.</p>
                  <p>The third effect mentioned in my Text of such an Effusion of the Spirit is this; The Godly shall then see, more clearly, the Lord Jesus pierced by their Sins; <hi>They shall look upon Me whom they have pierced, and mourn over him,</hi> says the Text.</p>
                  <p>Tho' Believers have at times now a sight of their Sin, wounding the Lord of Glory; yet then, they shall have a fuller, and a clearer view of their Iniquities, in their odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and loathsome nature, through the Glass of a Crucified Jesus. Oh then their Hearts will melt, and their Loyns will break with sighing for Sin, as beheld in this Glass! Oh! How will they mourn, and weep for, loath, confess, and forsake every Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51088:8"/>when they behold them all meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the dying <hi>Jesus of Nazareth!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine I intend to handle, I found on this Third Effect, and those Words in the Verse that express it; and it is as followeth:</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>The sight of our Sins, through the Glass of a Crucified Jesus, is the only thorough sight of Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I shall prove from the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth; and I begin with that place; Acts ii. 37. <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their Heart,</hi> &amp;c. The Prophesy in the Words of my Text then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan eminently to be accomplished. The Apostle and Disciples were filled with the Holy Ghost on that day of <hi>Pentecost;</hi> and the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> (after his recovery from so great a Fall) being endued with a mighty Power from on high, preached unto the a mazed Multitude, a Sermon concerning a Crucified Jesus; which he sums up <hi>Ver.</hi> 36. in these Words, <hi>Therefore let all the House of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus whom ye have Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, both Lord and Christ.</hi> Now when 3000 of them heard this, <hi>they were prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Heart.</hi> When they heard this: Heard what? That the Lord they had Crucified, was the Redeemer and Saviour. When they heard <hi>this,</hi> and were convinced of <hi>this;</hi> then did the Murder of the Lord Jesus appear in its dismal Colours; when
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51088:8"/>they heard and were perswaded of <hi>this;</hi> that the same Jesus whom they had Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, died for <hi>their</hi> Sins, and was bruised for <hi>their</hi> Iniquities; oh then! they saw their Sin to be such a Monster, that it cut them to the Heart. One glosses thus upon the Place. <hi>They were pricked to their Heart, and Sin was pricked to the Heart too.</hi> The Heart's blood of their Sin was let out.</p>
                  <p>It is evident from the Place, that their first Conviction was, that <hi>that</hi> Jesus they had Crucified was the Saviour; and that wounded them to the Heart; and then presently they were made to believe, he was <hi>their</hi> Saviour, and that made their Heart Wounds yet the deeper.</p>
                  <p>Turn again to <hi>Esay</hi> vi. 5. <hi>Then said I, woe is me, I am undone, because I am a Man of unclean Lips,</hi> &amp;c. But what is the matter? What made him of a sudden have such a fight of his own Vileness and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery? Read the following Words, and you shall know the Reason. <hi>For</hi> (says he) <hi>mine Eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Whence it follows, that a view of the Lord Jesus in his Glory, gives the Soul to see it's own Pollution and Misery; <hi>Then said I</hi> (i e. When he beheld the King in his Glory, he cryed out) <hi>woe is me!</hi> But this place of Scripture will still appear to be more pregnant to the purpose, if we weigh well, what it was to <hi>see the King in his Glory;</hi> and that also we shall find out
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51088:9"/>by the Assistance of the Spirit, in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of these following Things. 1. That this Chapter Prophetically treats of a Crucified Jesus, compare <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. with <hi>John</hi> xii. 41. and other Places. 2. From <hi>Ver.</hi> 1. it is plain; that his Glory was not only, <hi>that he was upon a Throne high and lifted up;</hi> but that also, <hi>his Train filled the Temple.</hi> 3. That his <hi>Train</hi> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Margin of some of your Bibles sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies his Skirts, <hi>i. e.</hi> of his Garments: His Garments, and the Skirts of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in Scripture Phrase, set forth his Righteousness. This did the Garments of the High-Priest of old Testify: To this that Parable alludes of the Woman that had the Bloody-Issue; says she, <hi>If I may but touch the Hem of his Garment,</hi> &amp;c. Which, no doubt, Spiritually unsterstood, signifies his Righteousness. So that this I infer from the Words; To have a sight, through Faith, of the Lord Jesus, in his Godlike Undertakings, is to have a sight of the King in his Glory; and such a sight by Faith, lets the poor Soul see its own Filthiness and Pollution.</p>
                  <p>The third Place I bring for a Proof, is <hi>Job</hi> xlii. 5, 6. <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the Ear, but now mine Eye seeth thee; Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</hi> There is many a Soul that hears of Christ in the sound of the Gospel, with the hearing of the Ear, and that gives them not a true sight of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51088:9"/>themselves; but, when they come by a sight of him wounded, and bruised for them, to see Sin and themselves, then they are made to abhor their Sins, that lay so heavy upon their dying Lord.</p>
                  <p>Having thus proved the Truth, I shall proceed to confirm, and illustrate it; and herein I shall follow this Method.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> I shall prove to you, that no Glass can render Sin so odious, and so exceeding sinful, as the Glass of a dying Jesus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Make it plain to you, how Sin comes through a powerful discovery of the Redemption of Christ Jesus, to appear so loathsome and detestable.</p>
                  <p>As to the first, there are but two Glasses besides this, through which Sin may be discover'd. The first is the Glass of the Law, through which Sinners are made by the Light of Nature, to see Sin upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Secondly, The Glass of Divine Vengeance in Hell, through which the Damned can do nothing but see Sin upon themselves.</p>
                  <p>I shall examine the first, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin seen in a state of Nature, by the Light of Nature, through the Glass of the Law. And here I grant, as the Apostle saith,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 20.</note>
                     <hi>That by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin;</hi> yet there is a vast difference between the Discovery of Sin by the same Law, in a state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51088:10"/>and in a state of Grace; However, in a state of Nature, the Righteous Law of God, let in by the Light of Nature into the Conscience, will convince of Sin, as the <hi>Men of Nineveh</hi> were convinc'd, or <hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Felix,</hi> by some strokes of the Spirit of Bondage.
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 14.</note> There are the Written Remains of the Law in every Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and their Conscience, by turns, accuses them, or excuses them, according as they do well or ill; and the outward Letter of the Law does improve those Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Remains, as God pleases; And when improved by common enlightning Gospel No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it oftentimes strikes deep into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, yet cannot then discover the root of Mischief within. This cannot be denied; that the Law gives to poor Souls, in a state of Nature, a sight of Sin; but yet thereby they do not see it in it's inward Malignancy, and what they do see of Sin, they only see it charged upon themselves, and not upon another. Now therefore Judge, O Sinner! what a dreadful sight of Sin this will be, to see it charged on thyself! What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation must this needs bring thy poor Soul under? What Horrours, and Terrours must thou be filled with? And when no Spirit of Life and Grace comes in, How can'st thou forsake that Sin, that still dogs thee, lays fast hold on thee, and drags thee away Captive? But there being no Renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace and Power given; for a Sinner to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51088:10"/>see his Sin, there can be no changing, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing sight by the Glass of the Law; again, except the Spirit of Bondage and Conviction come in also with the Light of Natural Conscience, it will be a <hi>short and dim sight of Sin,</hi> it cannot be but a trivial skin deep sight of Sin, even in a natural Man. What this Law of Nature may do, in subordination, and in subserviency to the Gospel, at the first coming of Grace, is not the Question at present; But I am now speaking of Convictions Natural, or Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral even by the Word of God, afore Grace comes, when the Soul is wholly under only the Law of natural Conscience; and this I shall prove, that meer Legal Convictions antecedent to Grace, do not give the Soul a thorough sight of Sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Light of Nature, or common Light is too weak and imperfect to take in the Law in its full extent, and Spirituality, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 9. How can they that are Deaf and Blind, in being dead in Trespasses and Sins, see or hear the full Demands of the Law they are under, or consider the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of its Condemnation?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is plain from Experience; That every Soul that has no more than such meer Legal Convictions, satisfies Conscience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the greatest Convictions and Horrours with its own doings, and seeks for <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Works of the Law. Acts</hi> xvi. 29, 30. Now were the Soul throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51088:11"/>of Sin, how greatly sin affronts In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Justice, asperses Infinite Holiness, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies Infinite Truth, and despises Infinite Sovereignty; it would never presume to think to make the least Reparation to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted Justice, and Injured Holiness, by any Repentings, Tears, or doings of its own. Could the Soul make a true estimate of Sin and Self, it would never offer its own Obedience and Sorrows at the Bar of God for Satisfaction. <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 9. But when the Commandments came, Sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived and I died. Compare with <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 7, 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>This is a most certain Rule; That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a Soul satisfies Conscience with; that's the Answer, that the Conscience gives to the Demands of the Righteous Law, and 'tis the Satisfaction it offers to injur'd Justice. If a Man satisfies his Conscience with the Death and Obedience of the Lord Jesus, by Faith received and applied: Then 'tis evident it offers the Righteousness of <hi>Christ</hi> to the Demands of Justice, and the Law. But if the Man quiets his raging Conscience with his Sorrows and Obedience, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniably evident, that <hi>that</hi> Man attempts to satisfy Justice, and the Demands of the Law, with his own Sorrows, (though filled with Enmity against God,) and his imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and impure Obedience. And this is a common Experience found in all, awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in a natural State; that then their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51088:11"/>greatest legal Convictions end in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science-peace, meerly acquired by the Deeds of the Law: And it is commonly discerned, a Soul convinced by the Law of Nature, or some general Light of Scripture, presently sets about doing; reforms, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles himself, weeps, mourns, hears, prays; and if he can but still Conscience thereby, he sits down in great Hopes and Security, though not upon a good Bottom. Ah! poor Soul, did'st thou but clearly know the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality of the Law, and the odious Nature of Sin, thou would'st not offer to bring thy Rags to an holy God, nor stand before him in thy Filth, and glory therein: And thy best Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are no other in a polluted State. God has a Bar in the Sinner's Conscience; and the Justice of God there, by his righteous Law, does impeach. Thou hast sinned, O Sinner, saith the Law in the Conscience; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Conscience is pained: Whatever now removes this Pain of Conscience, is the Answer given to this Demand of the Law; and the Answer of Sinners is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Degrees of Nature's Light. Some grosly ignorant plead this: God is Merciful; not knowing this, that there is not a Drop of Mercy to be had out of Christ. Others add to their Plea, these Things; They are Christians, Protestants, were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, are good <hi>Church-folks,</hi> devout at their Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereas all Things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ are but empty Names. Others
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51088:12"/>plead; They are not Drunkards, Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, Swearers, Sabbath-breakers, as some of their Neighbours are; but that they have a good Heart, have a good Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Sober, Just, and pay every Man his own; and live peaceably among their Neighbours. 'Tis well done to do so. Morality is lovely in its Place; but not well done to Trust to these Doings, and set up Morality in the Room of the Blood of Christ. Others can plead their Priviledges, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and Forms, and will be ready to flatter Conscience with such grounds of Hope as these. I am a Professor, hear the best Preaching and Preachers; nay, what's more, a Church-member also; <hi>I have eat and drunk in his Presence, and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied in his Name,</hi> Mat. vii. 22. All this may be, and yet being ignorant of Christ's Righteousness, and refusing to submit thereunto; Christ may profess he knows you not.</p>
                  <p>Whilst you satisfy Conscience with such Pleasure, you plainly seek to be justified by the Deeds of the Law; and so build upon a Quicksand, that unless you be moved to another Foundation, will swallow you down to the bottomless Pit.</p>
                  <p>Suppose the Judge of Quick and Dead was present here, in his terrible Majesty, and put this awful Question to each of you, as you sat upon your Benches. You have broke my Law, and offended my Justice;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51088:12"/>and my Justice must be vindicated, and my Law satisfied with a compleat Satisfaction. Consider seriously what answer could your Consciences make to him; Suppose he said to one of you; Thou hast sinned, and thou must die; plead, Sinner, plead: Wherefore should not Judgment be executed upon thee speedily? May be you would say, Truth Lord, I have offended; but spare me a little, and I will do somewhat to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy; I will pray, weep, mourn, reform, and endeavour to get a better and softer Heart. Truly 'tis thus, poor Souls, under meer general Convictions, are apt to deal with God.</p>
                  <p>But suppose the awful Judge should put the Question to another of you, that has been under Convictions of Sin, but now are secure again; Thou hast broken my Law, and art a Sinner, thou deservest eternal Damnation: Conscience, what Answer dost thou give? Ah Soul! perhaps this is all thy Conscience can plead; I have prayed, mourned, and repented; I am better than I was, and have a better Heart than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; nay, I have done this, and I have done that. But let me tell thee, this Plea will not do at God's Bar, when thou comest to stand naked there. This is not the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of a good Conscience.
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 21.</note>
                     <hi>The Answer of a good Conscience,</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>)
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51088:13"/>is not pleading, <hi>That it has put away the Filth of the Flesh:</hi> But the Answer of a good Conscience is, <hi>from the Death and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.</hi> Ah Soul! if thou hast nothing to plead but thine own Doings, thou wilt never stand in Judgment, but will be condemned for ever; thou and thy Rags must be cast into Hell. I do not dehort you from good Works done from a right Principle, but warn you of the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of pleading them for your Justification. I tell thee, Sinner, the Judge would soon over-throw such Pleadings; and thus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: <hi>Ah, but Conscience, my Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands perfect, compleat, and universal Obedience.</hi> Have you given in such an Obedience; Here thou must stand mute, for none living can have the Impudence to plead that; and no Plea short of such an Obedience, either performed by ourselves, or by another for us, will do for Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But if you would reply, <hi>Lord, though not perfectly, yet I have sincerely Obeyed, and is not that sufficient to my Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to obtain the Blessing for me.</hi> It would soon be answered: First, <hi>how do you know your Obedience is sincere?</hi> That <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> has not a Dram of <hi>Sincerity</hi> in it, that puts in for Justification, and does usurp the Throne of the <hi>Righteousness of my Son.</hi> But suppose your <hi>Obedience</hi> were <hi>sincere;</hi> By what Law of mine can you plead for <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>Justify?</hi> If you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51088:13"/>plead by any, it must be by some new Law of Mens setting up, and not by my good old Law. Have a care of being led to an <hi>Idol Justification:</hi> If you lean on so sandy a Foundation, you shall fall into the Ditch.</p>
                  <p>Yet again, what if you could perfectly obey for the time to come, what Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would you give for <hi>past Violations?</hi> Whereas the least Breach deserves what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever my <hi>infinite Justice</hi> can Inflict: If you will satisfy <hi>Justice</hi> yourself, you must go to <hi>Hell</hi> to satisfy; that's the Place of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for them that will pay in their own Persons, and the Time of paying for them is no less than <hi>ETERNITY.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But suppose again, <hi>O Sinner,</hi> the Judge should put the Question to the <hi>Believer</hi> that sits by thee. He would answer, <hi>Truly, Lord, I am by Nature involved in the Guilt of</hi> Adam<hi>'s first Sin; I have broke thy Law; I am filthy and polluted: I have been Guilty of innumerable Evils in</hi> Thought, Word, <hi>and</hi> Deed; <hi>Yet the Lord Jesus Christ has fully satisfied, and obeyed the Law for Sinners, yea, for the chiefest of Sinners; and such am I; and why not then for me?</hi> Nay, says another <hi>Soul</hi> that is stronger in Faith; <hi>he has done it for me.</hi> However, the meanest <hi>Believer</hi> can plead thus in his Conscience; <hi>Truth, Lord, I am a Dog; yet the Dogs eat of the Crumbs that fall from their Master's Table;</hi> Mat. xv. 27. I am as vile, as vile can be, yet
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51088:14"/>this is my Encouragement, <hi>That infinite Grace is infinitely freely offer'd to, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon the vilest of Sinners;</hi> And why may not I take it, <hi>in the Strength of Christ?</hi> But I can say, <hi>I am strip'd of all</hi> Pleas <hi>from my own</hi> Repentance <hi>and</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>yea, of all</hi> Pleas <hi>but this,</hi> viz. <hi>The</hi> Death <hi>and</hi> Obedience <hi>of the Son of God. I will stand and fall by what Christ hath done and suffered; and if the</hi> Satisfaction <hi>of Christ is not sufficient, I am satisfied to go to Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pardon this <hi>Digression.</hi> But this was the Intent of it, to fortify the Truth I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to advance: <hi>That a Sinner in a State of</hi> Nature, <hi>meerly under legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, satisfies his Conscience with his own Doings, and seeks for Satisfaction by the Works of the Law.</hi> Meer natural Conscience is wholly a Stranger to this Plea of the <hi>Believer,</hi> from the Death and Resurrection of Christ, and knows nothing of it: If he can attain to a little legal Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Reformation, he thinks it satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction enough. And the Reason is this, He has not a thorough sight of Sin by the <hi>Law:</hi> If he had, he would not dare bring his own dirty Doings, to plead for him for <hi>Deliverance</hi> and <hi>Acceptance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But e're I part with this <hi>Head,</hi> I shall leave the <hi>Remark</hi> behind. Would you know, whether your <hi>Convictions</hi> are <hi>saving?</hi> Take this Mark to know them by; if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51088:14"/>will satisfie your convinced Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but an <hi>Interest</hi> in the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> and you say in your Hearts with the poor Woman, <hi>Mat.</hi> ix. 21. <hi>If I may but touch the Hem of his Garment,</hi> even his Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness, <hi>I shall be made whole;</hi> but not before; for all other Physicians are Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of no value: Then 'tis apparent your <hi>Convictions</hi> are very hopeful.</p>
                  <p>Here is the great Difference between a <hi>meer natural Conviction,</hi> and those that are <hi>saving.</hi> The one awakened Person, takes up with any thing to satisfy his <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;</hi> appeases the Storm thereof by <hi>Prayer,</hi> a few <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Duties:</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Isaiah</hi> lv. 1, 2. comp. <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 6.</note> But the other continues hungring and thirsting for the Righteousness the Lord Jesus has wrought out, and nothing short of that will quench his Thirst. Says the <hi>poor Soul, I will follow on after a bleeding Jesus; I will continue to lean by his Spirit, on his Death and Satisfaction, 'till I come to some well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Hopes and Assurance that I am washed in his Blood, and cloathed with his Righteousness.</hi> What is the Reason that this Soul will be satisfied in no peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, short of what accrues thereunto from the apprehended Righteousness of Christ? <hi>Answ.</hi> Because it has been so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced of its Sin and Misery, that it apprehends nothing will purge it,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51088:15"/>and cover it, nothing will deliver it from Wrath, and recommend it to the Father, but the God-like Righteousness of Christ Jesus our blessed Lord.</p>
                  <p>Hence it follows, and from all that hath been spoken under this Head, <hi>That the Sinner in a State of Nature, meerly thro' the Glass of the Law, has not a full and thorough Sight of Sin:</hi> So far, I mean, as either natural Light or common Grace hath the Management of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Sight of Sin, meerly thro' the Glass of the Law, is but a killing Sight of Sin, bringing in Condemnation. The Word of God calls it, <hi>a Killing Letter,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 6. <hi>Who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament, not of the Letter.</hi> (By which he means the Moral Law) <hi>but of the Spirit; for the Letter kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, but the Spirit giveth Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Apostle opposes the Dispensation of the Law, and that of the Gospel, and calls that of the Law, <hi>The killing Letter;</hi> so also he calls the Ministration of the Law, <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. <hi>The Ministration of Death;</hi> and, <hi>The Ministration of Condemnation, Ver.</hi> 9. opposing to it the <hi>Ministration of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, vid.</hi> which he calls, <hi>The Ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, ver.</hi> 8. 'Tis farther evinced from <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 9, 10. So that you may see a sight of Sin meerly through the Glass of the Law, is a killing Sight of Sin, bringing the Soul under guilt, and condemnation.</p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:51088:15"/>
                  <p> I might add, The Law makes no true, real, spiritual Change to Holiness and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; that is wholly wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, changing the Soul into that Image of Holiness; the Gospel, together with the Law, and by the Law, as written upon the Heart spiritually represents, and thereby changes into the same Image, from Glory to Glory, by the Lord, that Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed, suffer me to make a little Application of this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> An Use of Examination to poor Sinners. Examine what sort of Peace of Conscience you have, and how you came by it. I do not know how any of you here in <hi>London,</hi> can be under any ignorant Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, where there is so much Preaching; enough, at least, to rouze up the Law in your Consciences: I scarce think, that any of you have lived, so long without Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in your Consciences. How camest thou, O Sinner! to be at Peace within now? And yet thou art, at this Moment, as much hanging over Hell, as if Hell Fire were roaring in thy Conscience. Hast thou not worn off Convictions of Sin, by some obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of thine own? Hast thou not choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bribed thy Conscience by a few Sorrows, Tears, Prayers, and a little Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? And may be now thou art Two-fold more a Child of the Devil than before. He that still attempts to heal his Conscience these Ways, comes, at last, to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51088:16"/>have an hardened Conscience, and then he sins without controul. This I affirm to thee, poor Sinner, thou never canst attain to true Peace in thy Bosom, till thou comest to the Glass of a Crucified Jesus, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdest thy Sin laid upon him. See, Oh! see by Faith, the Lamb of God groaning under the Burthen of thy Sin. Behold him <hi>charg'd with thy Sorrows, bearing thy Grief, smitten for thy Transgressions, and wounded for thine Iniquity.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Isaiah</hi> liii. 4, 5, 6.</note> Then thou wilt fee indeed, what a poisonous Hellish Thing Sin is, worse than the Devil himself. Wouldst thou see the damning Nature of Sin, and mourn aright over it? Let thy Faith take a Prospect what Sin did to the Son of God, <hi>i. e.</hi> because of the Sins of the Elect he was thus served. Sin brought him down from Heaven, into the Form of a Servant, and likewise of sinful Flesh, Sin stript him of all; Sin wounded, smote, and bruised him; Sin made him cry, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> Mat. xxvii 46. Sin brought him to death, and the Grave. And now tell me is not Sin an odious, horrid Thing, yea, exceeding sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? and a worse Name cannot be given it than sinful Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Second Use is to poor Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and 'tis an Use of Caution, <hi>viz.</hi> That they diligently attend to the Voice
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51088:16"/>of the Spirit, that Preaches up the Blood of Jesus in the Conscience, and not to the Voice of the Law, that thunders out there Death and Condemnation.</p>
                  <p>There are Two Covenants in every Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's Conscience, Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and Mount <hi>Zion;</hi> the one gendereth to Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, the other to Liberty, <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 21. <hi>to the End.</hi> There are two Roots and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples whence all their Actions spring, <hi>viz.</hi> Law and Gospel: And these two Principles are as two Preachers in the Soul; the one, the Law, the other, the Blessed Spirit the Comforter. The Law preaches up, <hi>Do for Life,</hi> Rom. x. 5. do in your own Strength, or in the Strength of what you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. The Spirit preaches, <hi>Believe for Life,</hi> Rom. x. 9. Gal. iii. 11. <hi>Be strong in the Lord, and in the Power of his might,</hi> Ephes. vi. 10. <hi>Be strong within in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus,</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 1. Says the Law still in the Conscience; Do this, and do that for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Wrath, acceptance with God, and Peace of Conscience: Says the Spirit, Believe on the Lord Jesus for Eternal Life, and Acceptance; and Grace rested on will give Strength for all holy Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Now, O Believer! hear thou what the Spirit of God says; Believe continually on the Lord Jesus for Justification, and thereby derive Strength every Moment for the carrying on the Work of Sanctification.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:51088:17"/>
                  <p> Again, under the Guilt of Sin; the Law, or the Old Covenant, thunders out in the Conscience Death, and Condemnation; and, as meerly Law, drives away the Soul from the true Grace in Christ; and, by consequence, toward the Confines of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair; and, as Men legally understand it, charges the Soul not to presume to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Pardoning Grace; but first smart deeply under the Anguish of its inward Wounds, make strong Vows, Resolutions, and reform, before it once offer to think of a Pardon. But the Spirit that ministers Righteousness, and Peace, softly, whispers: Look, O Guilty Soul! to a bleeding Jesus; make fresh Applications to the Blood of Sprinkling: First get a renewed Sight of thy Pardon, then thou wilt indeed weep, mourn, and detest Sin, and Self; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it, and forsake it over the Head of the Sacrifice. Though thou hast done very evil, yet return to a Crucified Jesus. Oh Soul! hearken to what the Spirit says in thy Conscience, <hi>then shall thy Peace be as a River, with broad Streams,</hi> and thy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness shall flow like thy Peace too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There's a third Glass to see Sin in, and that's the Glass of Divine Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in Hell, <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 22. There is a Sight of Sin to be had, but a very dreadful one. The Damned in Hell have a great Sight of Sin indeed; but it is a damning, despairing, infuriating Sight of Sin; it's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51088:17"/>that that pains and torments, and stirs them up to all manner of Enmity and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies: Conviction of Sin there is their Torment and Despair; the more they see it, the more they are tormented and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. I would advise none of you to go there to obtain Convictions of Sin; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you may be convinced of Sin fully, and to purpose, in the Glass of a crucified Jesus. Yet I deny not, under Christ, it is good to understand Sin by the Wrath of Hell, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore dispatched the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the two former Glasses; I shall now proceed to examine the Nature of the Conviction of Sin through the Glass of a dying satisfying Jesus. And,</p>
                  <p>First. There the Soul has a full Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin. When a Soul comes to see its own Sin by Faith laid on a Crucifyed Jesus, it is then made to see Sin indeed in it's odious and proper Colours; to be, as it is, exceeding sinful. This is the scope of the Prophesy in my Text. When they shall see him whom their Sins have pierced, they shall not only mourn, but be in great bitterness. So the Three Thousand in the Acts, <hi>when they heard this,</hi> that it was <hi>Jesus they had Crucified, they were cut to the Heart.</hi> We are apt to have slight, and overly Thoughts of Sin; excepting when we are perswaded in our Conscience, how much the least sinful Thought of ours cost
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51088:18"/>our dearest Jesus: Oh could we but see how greatly our least of Sins wounded him, and brought down the Floods of Divine Wrath on him! Now nothing could deliver us from that Hell, which the least vain Thought of ours deserves; but those heavy, and unspeakable Sufferings of the Son of God, to whom was wrung the Dregs of the Cup of Vengeance; it would not only make us watch over every thought with holy Jealousy; but abhor, and dread every evil Imagination of our Hearts. We can let Thousands of Thoughts pass through our Hearts without Examination, and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of evil Thoughts, without the least regret of Conscience. But did we always look to a bleeding Jesus, sweating out clod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Blood, under the heavy Burthen of every Sin of ours; did we bring this and that, and a third vain and idle Thought to the Bloody Sacrifice; and see by Faith, at what an expensive Rate the Lord of Glory blotted them out, even by his own Blood and Death, it would give us a true estimate of Sin indeed. Thus you see, that in the Glass of a Crucified Jesus, the Soul, through Faith, may have a full Sight of Sin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In this Glass, a Soul, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, has a saving Sight of Sin: You have heard, that in Hell they have a great Sight of Sin, but it is a damning Sight. The Law, in a state of Nature, does also give a Sight of Sin; but it is a condemning
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51088:18"/>and tormenting Sight of Sin. 'Tis only a Sight of Sin in this Glass drives a Soul from Sin and Self, to lean upon and embrace the Lord Jesus and his Righteousness. This Sight of Sin does always attend saving Grace, and is inseparable from true Faith, as hath been already proved. In short, it is such a Sight of Sin, as the saved ones that are effectually called, only have.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In this Glass, A Man has a Soul purifying Sight of Sin. Sin reigns most when it reigns in the Dark. Sin discovered to a Soul, in a right Way, is Sin dethron'd; and nothing makes such a discovery of Sin to the Soul, (as hath been already proved) like the Blood of Jesus shed in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Sin also rightly mourned over, is Sin in mortifying; and nothing makes the Soul so kindly to mourn for Sin, as the Sight of him bleeding to death for Sin, whom Sin has pierc'd; as is evident from the Words of my Text. Again, Sin loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and detested by the Soul, is Sin a dying in the Soul; and 'tis our Sin, as we see it on a Crucified Jesus, (and that in an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Manner,) we only rightly loath and detest. This is the Manner and Nature of discover'd Grace, powerfully manifested in the Conscience, as it is written, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xvi. 62, 63. <hi>And I will establish my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; that thou may'st remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and be confounded, and never open
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51088:19"/>thy Mouth any more, because of thy Shame when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou hast done saith the Lord.</hi> From which Words observe to the Point in hand;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That God begins first to give his Grace to the Soul; <hi>I will establish my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That Grace seizing the Soul, spreads before it the Filth and Rancor of its Rebellions, <hi>that thou may'st remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That a saving Sight of the Guilt thereof done away by the Blood of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and God reconciled to us in his dying Son, is that that stirs up in the Soul a genuine Shame for, and loathing of all its Iniquities. <hi>And never open thy Mouth any more because of thy Shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done,</hi> (not only thy Unrighteousness, but thy best Righteousness in a natural State) saith the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is made evident to you, that a Sight of our Sins, like <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Host, drowned in the Red-Sea of the Blood of Jesus, will create in us an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abhorrence of them all; and not only Sin, but Self too, the Vessel that contains Sin. A surfeited Person oftentimes not only loaths the Food that caus'd the Surfeit, but the Dish whereon the surfeiting Dainties were laid. Thus Sin and Self, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Man's Self-righteousness being the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51088:19"/>Daggers that pierc'd the Lord of Glory; Will not you, O Sinners! hate the Daggers that kill'd the Glorious Saviour? Will not you, O Believers! loath the Poison and the Dish wherein that was contain'd, that Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd your best of Friends, your Well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, who's altogether lovely? 'Twas your Sins put him to death, and will you not loath and abhor Sin then?</p>
                  <p>But in the next Place; The hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and Evangelical Confession of Sin, is the stabbing of Sin to the Heart. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, only acknowledge thine Iniquities, wherein thou hast trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress'd,</hi> &amp;c. And nothing will draw forth such real Confession of Sin, as the Sight of Sin pardoned, and done away in the Blood of Atonement. Thus the Prodigal, <hi>Luke</hi> xv. when he was convinc'd <hi>there was Bread enough in his Father's House, and to spare,</hi> (to wit) pardoning Grace enough in Christ; he was resolved to arise and make his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to his Father, <hi>Ver.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>But when his Father saw him a far off, with compassion ran, and fell on his Neck and kissed him,</hi> i. e. made him believe Pardon and Reconciliation in the Blood of his Son; he then breaks forth into an ingenious and filial Confession of Sin indeed; crying out, <hi>Father, I have sinned again Heaven, and in thy Sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ver.</hi> 20, 21. Hence it's plain, nothing will so melt down a proud
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51088:20"/>and stubborn Heart, into a sweet Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and humble acknowledgment of Sin; as the Discovery Faith makes of Jesus wounded for our Sins, <hi>and bruised for our Iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Nothing makes us so really for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake Sin, as to lay Sin upon and confess it over the Sacrifice, and the fiducial Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on Pardon and Mercy obtain'd thereby:
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> xxviii. 13. comp. with <hi>Lev.</hi> xvi. 21.</note> And God in causing Souls to believe, <hi>that their Sins and Iniquities he'll remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber no more:</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> viii. 10. comp. with 12.</note> Writes the New Law of <hi>Grace and Holiness on the Hearts,</hi> which opposes and contradicts the Law of Sin which is in the Members.</p>
                  <p>From what has been said under this Head, it undeniably follows, That a Sight of Sin in the Glass of a crucified Jesus, is a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purifying Sight of Sin: And by the Thread of the Discourse hitherto, we are led to this, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there is no such Sight of Sin, as the Glass of a dying satisfying Saviour gives.</p>
                  <p>The Reasons to confirm the Truth which I shall at present insist on, flow from the two general Heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Appears by Comparison.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Law, inserting its Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in the Conscience, through the Light of self-discovering Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:51088:20"/> I. From Comparison: Comparison is an excellent Way whereby to arrive at any Knowledge, especially the Knowledge of ourselves. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in his <hi>Institutions,</hi> contends, <hi>That there can be no right Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Self, but by the Light of the Knowledge of God,</hi> And to be sure he means, <hi>God in Christ.</hi> His Reasons are, <hi>That the Perfections of God, are the righteous Rules to discover our Imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Such is our Innate Pride, that we seem naturally Upright and Righteous to ourselves; unless we be convinced by manifest Arguments of our Injustice, Filthiness, Foily, and Impurity; whereof we cannot be convinced, if we look only to ourselves, and not to God: And because Hypocrisy and Self-flattery are so natural to Sinners; Therefore a vain shew of Uprightness pleases them instead of Uprightness itself: And because there is nothing within them, nor about them, but what's horribly defiled; therefore they are taken with every Thing which seems to be removed but a little De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Pollution, even so long as they limit their Minds within the Bounds of human Corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He explains his Meaning by these apt Similitudes: <hi>If an Eye used only to</hi> black Colours, <hi>should fix upon</hi> Grey, <hi>it would judge it the</hi> whitest Colour <hi>in the World; but if it should see</hi> fine white Holland, <hi>and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51088:21"/>that set by the</hi> Grey, <hi>the</hi> Grey <hi>would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have little or no</hi> Whiteness.</p>
                  <p>Thus on the contrary, Persons discovering Sin by the Law, through the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has some dim Sight of Sin's Filthiness: But when Sin appears compared with the Person and Righteousness of Christ, and the Love and Grace of God in him, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears exceeding filthy indeed.</p>
                  <p>Again, he uses this Comparison: <hi>When the</hi> Eye <hi>sees the Shining of the Sun on the Ground, and dwells upon it, then the</hi> Man <hi>concludes his</hi> Eye-sight <hi>very strong; but when he looks up to the</hi> Body <hi>of the</hi> Sun, <hi>with the same</hi> Eye, <hi>he then experiences the</hi> Weakness <hi>of his</hi> Sight.</p>
                  <p>Thus when we go forth to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Duties, directed thereunto on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Light of Nature; we are apt to conclude we have Strength enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them: But when we come to see into the Spirituality of Duties in the Light of Reigning Grace, and the Righteousness of Christ, we then find our greatest Strength to obey, to be but meer Weakness. Most certain it is, that this Way of Comparison convinces a Soul most effectually of its Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and Misery. A <hi>Black-a-moor,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Black-a-moors,</hi> seems beautiful to itself; but set in the Company of Fair and beautiful Whites, he then may appear to himself and others to be swarthy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. Thus Sin appearing in the Light
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:51088:21"/>of the Perfect and God-like Righteousness of Christ, standing nigh to discover it, does appear exceeding sinful indeed. Suppose a Country where People of all Degrees, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Sexes, went cloathed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but tatter'd Rags, and saw no other; they would conclude the Rags the best Garments in the World, and none should perswade them to the contrary: But if they were brought into the Company of Princes, cloath'd with Gold and Purple, and rich Apparel; they would then see their Rags to be vile and loathsome; they would soon be ashamed of them, and ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change them for those splendid Robes. Thus as long as poor Sinners are in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral State, whilst their Eyes are with-held, that they can see no better than their own Righteousness; they think their own Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness to be very Glorious, and that it must needs be well-pleasing to God. But when the Spirit of Grace opens their Eyes to see the Excellency and Beauty of the Righteousness of Christ; they then cry out,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Isa.</hi> lxiv. 6.</note> That their own Righteousness is but as <hi>filthy Rags, and menstruous Cloaths:</hi>

                        <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 7, 8.</note> And, <hi>what was gain to them before, they now count loss and dross, and Dogs Meat, in comparison of the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ and his Righteousness.</hi> In the like manner also, the Greatness of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51088:22"/>Man's Misery is discovered from the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Excellency, and Dignity of their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer</hi> and <hi>Redeemer.</hi> Great must that Man's Captivity be, that a Potent-King with a Puissant Army must needs come to his Rescue? How deeply into Misery must the Elect by the Fall be sunk, when the <hi>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</hi> must come down from Heaven to be their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer! See <hi>Isa.</hi> lix. 16. to this Purpose. The Inexpressible Greatness of Fallen Man's Sinfulness and Misery, will be very manifest, if we consider these following Things, in Relation to the Redeemer and Works of Redemption.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Excellency and Dignity of his Person.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>His Endearedness and Nearness to those he undertook for.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>What was Done and Suffer'd by Him in order to their Rescue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The Vileness and Meanness of them he has Redeemed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that we might more fully discover the Nature of Sin and Misery; We shall consider the Dignity and Person of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer: He that suffer'd for, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demed from Sin, was the <hi>Great THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANTHROPOS, God and Man in One Person.</hi> The <hi>Glorious EMANUEL. God with us,</hi> Matth. i. 21. <hi>The Eternal Word that was with God; and was God made Flesh, and Tabernacled amongst us,</hi>

It was this excellent Man as

                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:51088:23"/> 2dly, And that you might, O Believers! Inhance the more this Consideration, add thereunto the Thoughts of his Endeared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to you. It was not only this Glorious Person; but this <hi>lovely One,</hi> Psalm xlv. 2. Who is <hi>fairer than the Sons of Men.</hi> Who is <hi>altogether lovely,</hi> Cant. v. 16. Who is made up of nothing else but <hi>Love,</hi> Isa. lii. 14. That had his <hi>Visage</hi> more marr'd than any Man's. This He <hi>put away your Sins by, the Sacrifice of himself,</hi> Heb. i. 3. 'Tis he who has an Infinite Ocean of Love and Pity in his Heart towards poor Sinners; and an Infinite Fulness of Grace in his Hand to bestow; and an Infinity of Grace <hi>poured on his Lips,</hi> Psalm xlv. 3. <hi>Whose Mouth is most sweet,</hi> Cant. v. 16. <hi>Whose Lips drop Honey and Wine,</hi> — 4, 11. <hi>Who hath purchased Gifts for the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,</hi> Psalm xlviii. 17. <hi>Whose Mercies are renewed every Morning, who waits to be gracious,</hi> Isa. xxx. 18. to rebellious Sinners, and rebellious Revolters: Who follows run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagate Enemies and Deserters, with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Arms to embrace them, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest Bowels of pity to relieve them, and reduce them; as he followed <hi>Adam</hi> in the Garden flying away from him; Or as the streaming Rock in the Wilderness pursu'd close the Footsteps of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> when they turned back to Mount <hi>Horeb,</hi> or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Egypt.</hi> It was this Person, I say, that was the rich Store-house of Grace, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51088:24"/>Pity, that <hi>became a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Griefs,</hi> for thee, O Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever! who was <hi>wounded for thy Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, and bruised for thine Iniquities,</hi> Isa. liii. 3. Then what a malignant, mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous, and hellish a Thing Sin is? that cost the Fountain of Love, this Store-house of Grace, so many bitter Wounds, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Bruises.</p>
                  <p>Again consider, his nearness to you in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, who was the great Sufferer for you; And what an astonishing Royal Favour is this, that the King and Judge should suffer Punishment for the Criminal at the Bar?</p>
                  <p>He also stileth himself <hi>your Friend.</hi> Thus he saith, <hi>John</hi> xv. 15. <hi>Henceforth I call you not Servants, for the Servant knoweth not what his Lord doth; but I have called you Friends,</hi> &amp;c. And what Love of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship was there, that so great, so inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Friend, should lay down his Life for those that were Enemies to him?</p>
                  <p>In the next Place consider, he was your Brother, that indured those bitter Things for you; so it is written of him, Heb. ii. 13. <hi>For which Cause he is not asham'd to call them Brethren.</hi> Thus again, <hi>Math.</hi> ii. 10. <hi>Jesus bad the two Maryes go tell his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Peter, that they should go into Galilee, and there they should see him.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve this wonder of Mercies, that the first Term he should give to those that deserted him, in his greatest Extremity, should be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51088:24"/>that of Brethren. And Oh! be amazed at this Love, that your eldest Brother should die, to deliver you from Hell and Death! Ah! How much did your Sins cost your dear eldest Brother?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, He was your Husband, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed you to be his Bride, at such a dear Rate. And Oh! will it not melt thy Heart, that thy Beloved should bear such stripes, and blows from Divine Justice for thee! How must it needs make thee loath thy Sins, that acted such a dismal Tragedy, upon so great and dear a Relation?</p>
                  <p>And, Thirdly, That you might see Sin more odious, and the inexpressible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your Misery by Nature; consider the greatness of your Deliverance. The Ransom he paid to redeem, was exceeding great. The Power he is armed with to rescue, is infinitely great. His Intercession that crowns all, is all-sufficient, and all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing. His Sufferings that went into his Ransom were inestimably great in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Consider but the Sufferings of his Body, and they were the greatest could be thought on. <hi>He was a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief. His Visage was marr'd more than any Man's,</hi> Isa. liii. 3. <hi>He gave his Back to the Smiters, and his Cheeks to them that plucked off the Hair; he hid not his Face from Shame and Spiting,</hi> Isa. l. 6. He was betray'd by his Follower with a treacherous Kiss; seiz'd on, as a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51088:25"/>Murtherer, by Men arm'd with Swords and Staves. He was most inhumanly scoft at, and insulted over with bitter Taunts and Jears. He was most cruelly, and most bloodily scourged, taken to Prison, from Prison to Judgment, and from thence to Execution; wherein he endured the most vile, cursed and painful Death of the Cross. And he <hi>that thought it no Robbery to be equal with God, became obedient to the Death, even to the Death of the Cross,</hi> 1 Phil. ii. 6. Lay this to heart, O Believer! that thy Face being impudent in sinning, made his Face be so marr'd and bruised. Thine Eyes being so satiated with behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vanity, made his Eyes so glutted with beholding cruelty acted on himself. Thine Ears being so accustomed to sinful Speeches, made his Ears be dug so deep. Thy Throat being an open Sepulchre of all Wickedness, made his Throat so dry with crying out, <hi>Psal.</hi> xl. 6. Thy Back being so loaded with the Burden of Sin, made his Back be all over torn with dismal Stripes. Thy Flesh being the Servant of Sin, made his Flesh be so nail'd and pierc'd; tell me, whilst thou considerest this in Faith, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou canst, in the least, relish Sin? Add unto this, the Consideration of the Sufferings of his Soul. His Soul being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding heavy, and fore amazed with dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Consternation; proclaimeth Sin to be a dreadful Weight indeed! <hi>Mark</hi> xiv. 43.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51088:25"/>His Soul being surrounded with most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Sorrows, even unto Death, shows what a heavy Burden thy Sins are, <hi>Math.</hi> xxvi. 38. His Praying, <hi>That if it were possible the Cup of Vengeance might pass from him,</hi> Mark xiv. 35. and his conflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agonies with Cataracts of Divine Wrath poured forth plentifully upon his Soul; till it made him Sweat Clodders of Blood; sufficiently testify how hot the Wrath of God burned against Sin, when thus it flamed so vehemently against his Beloved Son, that never offended him; only for imputed Sin. His crying out, under a great desertion, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> doth abundantly witness how much the holy Nature of God loatheth Sin, and what an infinite separation it createth between God and the Soul. Over and above all this; these Sufferings being the Sufferings of God-man; and therefore of an infinite, eternal and unchangeable Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, Virtue, and Dignity, do plainly evince this, that Sin hath highly offended God. If we join to this that the Person suffering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indued with an omnipotency of Power, backing all with a never-failing Intercession; does declare Man's Misery as well as Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to be exceeding great and deplorable. Thus I have dispatched that Head, viz. The Greatness of that Ransom he laid down: And pass to the last Consideration,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51088:26"/>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> To aggravate Man's Sin and Misery; From</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Meaness and Vileness of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he redeemed. Therefore,</p>
                  <p>Lastly consider; that this glorious Person endured all this for the foolish, base, vile, and contemptible Things of the World, whom the World terms and esteems the off scouring of all Things; and not for the <hi>high, wise, rich, and noble Men of the World; that so no Flesh might glory in his Presence,</hi> 1 Cor. v. 26, 27, 28, 29. Besides this, It was for Sinners, and the greatest of Sinners too, and considered as such, that he endured the Cross, despised the Shame: It was for a persecuting, blaspheming <hi>Paul;</hi> for a <hi>Mary Magdalene;</hi> for notorious Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that he bore all the Weight of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: He accepted of, and undertook for, rejoyced over, and satisfied for the whole <hi>Elect,</hi> considered in the corrupt Mass, and sunk into the deepest and vilest Apostacy, <hi>Rom.</hi> v 6. <hi>For when we were without Strength, in due time Christ died for the Ungodly.</hi> Verse 8. <hi>But God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his Love to us, in that while we were yet Sinners Christ died for us.</hi> Our Lord Jesus viewed us, and considered us in the Height of our Wickedness and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, when his Love over-swelled all Banks, to cause him to make his Soul an Offering for our Sin.</p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:51088:26"/>
                  <p> Now lay all these Considerations together, and through the Prospective-Glass of Faith, take a View how much they heighten and greaten the Sinfulness and Misery of <hi>Fallen Man,</hi> and that by Comparison. If a King's only Son should disrobe himself of all Glory, and forsake the Delights and Honours of his Father's Presence and Palace, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, dress himself in Rags to accompany a tatter'd perishing Beggar in a nasty Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; and not only so, but voluntarily give his Flesh to be torn off by hot Pincers, that he might not only save a Wretch from Exquisite Torments, but that also she might be washed, made clean, and richly apparelled and brought to his Bed and Throne. One might easily conclude the Greatness of the Love of this Royal Prince to her. So also infer the Greatness of the Offence and Misery; when no less would serve to rescue her from deserved Punishment, than the cruel Tortures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon so innocent and glorious a Prince. After the same manner we may argue, how greatly did Jesus love indeed! And how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakably Great was our Rebellion and Misery, that nothing else could Redeem us but the Blood and Death of the Son of God; that left his Father's Bosom and Glory; was made in the <hi>Form of a Servant, and of no Reputation; who humbled himself to the Death of the Cross,</hi> Phil. ii. 7, 1. For such fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Rebels as we, that lay upon the Dunghill
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51088:27"/>of <hi>polluted Nature, cast out there in our Blood in the open Field, to our shame, and the loathing of our Persons!</hi> Ezek. xvi. 5. Let me tell thee, Poor Soul, if thou wouldst see what a wretched, vile, polluted Creature thou art; Go, and see by Faith, the Son of God bleeding to Death for thee. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Poor Soul, that the Lord of Heaven must leave his Father's Bosom to dwell in Flesh, and make his Soul an Offering for Sin, to snatch thee from Misery. How inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressibly great must thy Misery then be, That the Son of God in our Nature, (who was equal with his Father, in Power and Glory) should conquer Death for us! This doth plainly shew, what a Death we in the <hi>Fall of Adam</hi> had incurred! Sinners, would you see the Greatness of your Misery? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Greatness of your Redemption! Would you search out the horrid Nature of Sin? Oh search narrowly how much your Sins cost the dearest Jesus! Would you understand how an Infinite God Resenteth Sin? Behold him wounding his innocent Son (that never offended him;) only for Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Sin!</p>
                  <p>If you would understand how much Sin affronted his Justice, Government, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. See, Oh see! the Flaming Sword of Justice sheathed in the Bowels of <hi>his Shepherd, even the Man that was God's Fellow!</hi> Zech. xiii. 7.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:51088:27"/>
                  <p> And if you would know how much his Infinite Holiness is set against Sin, Take a View by Faith, how much he vindicated his own wronged Holiness from the Asper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of our Iniquities upon his Dearest Son: He would not bate him any thing, but lest him to contest with his fiercest Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, that he might be honour'd, Sin atoned for, and the Sinner saved. Perhaps you may make nothing of many Thousands of sinful Thoughts, but no less Blood than the Blood of the Son of God can wash away the least Sin of a Thought. 4. Come and sit down with Astonishment in viewing this unfathomable Love and Mercy, that the Son of God should so stand under the Weight of his Father's Justice, to purchase to himself a filthy, vile, deformed Bride, to take her into his Arms, and set her upon his Throne! This sheweth, that the Sin of Unbelief that Affronts so much Love, is worse than Hell; because it makes all this Love to be nothing. Oh, the Sorrows that drank up his Spirits! And he bore them all for our Sins, and yet can we have slighty Thoughts of Sin? Can you pass over Sin without loathing and detesting it; Can you give covetous and ambitious Thoughts, and Thoughts of Pleasure, a quiet lodging in your Breasts? Can you rowl sinful Words with delight under your Tongues, and rush without Regret upon ungodly Actions, when you thus behold them meeting upon a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51088:28"/>Saviour, acting the greatest cruelty upon his wounded and tormented Soul and Body? O Believers! Can you be pleased with those heavy Cloggs and Weights that prest your Beloved to Death? And can you have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Thoughts of that Dagger that stabs him now to the Heart, the cursed Sin of Unbelief? I mean, that Sin of Sins, that spits in the Face of all his Love, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiseth and nullifies all his Sufferings; and with scorn and contempt treads under foot a bleeding Jesus. Yea, to sum up all, that is the great Floodgate that lets in all other Iniquities; and though Believers are guilty of Thousands of Acts of Unbelief every Day, yet it is strange to observe how little sensible they are thereof: Many have not the least akeing of Heart about it all the Day long; nor do they think it worth their Notice and Observation. You may hear many of their Prayers fill'd with plausible Confessions, and yet scarce ever hear this Sin confest and acknowledg'd at all; though this Sin cost the Lord Jesus more dear than any; because they believe not on him, which is Crucifying him afresh.</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, Sinners arrive at a thorough Sight of Sin, through the Glass of a crucified Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus; because Faith apprehending him, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Law more spiritual in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>i. e.</hi> makes the Conscience appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it more spiritually than ever it did
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51088:28"/>before. I do not say, that the Law doth not at all convince of vile Affections in a natural State; for it is evident to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Yet this I can venture to Affirm, that the Law brings it upon the Conscience in a far more full Extent and Spirituality after Grace comes, than before; so that through Faith the Law is not only estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, but appears more spiritual in the Soul.</p>
                  <p>In clearing of this weighty Point, I shall first shew, That the Law doth not afore Faith, let in a Light sufficient for a thorough Conviction. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2dly, That at the first regenerating work of the Spirit, the Law lets in a sufficient Light for a thorough Conviction of Sin. And,</p>
                  <p n="3">3dly, Demonstrate, That this thorough Conviction of Sin and Misery, by the Law exerting greater Spirituality through the Sight of Reigning Grace, intervenes in order of Nature, between the infused Principle of Faith, and the Act of Faith flowing from thence, or between Faith eyeing Christ, or Faith coming to Christ.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with the First, <hi>viz.</hi> The Law doth not let in a thorough Conviction of Sin before Faith. This hath been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led particularly already; I shall now dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it more Argumentatively from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Experience, yet with brevity.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:51088:29"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. It is impossible for a Man Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually blind to see himself as he ought. The Scripture calls Men in a state of Nature, Spiritually blind, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. 21. Therefore until the Moment their State is changed by Grace, (notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Remainders of natural Light, and Law in the Conscience) a Sinner must needs continue very blind, as to the Things of God, and his own miserable Condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. As a dead Corps cannot see nor feel, what case it is in, though in the midst of raging Flames; or under the Weight of a House oppressing it with its Ruins. So one that is Dead in Sin, cannot see nor feel the Weight of its Sinfulness and Misery, until that Moment it is made alive in Christ. And the Scriptures Affirm, that Men in a natural State, are dead in Trespasses and Sins, Ephes. ii. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'till reigning Grace in their actual Union to Christ, makes them to live: Therefore there can be no thorough Sight of Sin and Self in the Soul, till reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace first takes hold of the Soul.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. Sinners in a State of Nature are represented as spiritually Deaf, <hi>Luke</hi> xiv. so that they cannot hear the full Voice of the Law, no more than the Gospel. 'Tis but little that the Ears of the Soul perceive in a natural State, of the Thunder, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest, and Lightning of <hi>Mount Sinai.</hi> Could a Soul in an unregenerate State, take in the full Voice of the Law, it would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51088:29"/>be sunk into Despair. Unregenerate Souls (while so) are kept under the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Power of natural Unbelief, as well as fill'd with a total Enmity to supernatural Faith. They do not fully and constantly believe the Commands and Threats of the Law that they are under and in bondage unto; which if they did do, they durst as well meddle with burning Coals, as with immoral Evil against the Ten Commands. And also without a Discovery of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, (which the Law doth not) they would soon sink into the bottomless Pit of Despair, not being able to bear the Weight of the Law's condemnation: So that there is in corrupt Nature, a prevalent Disbelieving of, and not hearkning to the Exaction and Condemnation of the Law in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that they are married unto, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 1, 2. Hence it is, that it is impossible for the Soul in the State of Corruption, to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to the Conviction of Sin, as shall make it totally despair of its Self.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The Light of Nature is dim and faint, without being assisted and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by a supernatural Light, to let in the Perfection of the Law upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. The Cranny is too small to let in the full brightness of that Sun. There is no proportion at all between the Object, and the visive Power and Faculty; and where that is wanting, the object cannot be received and converted within the Fulness
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51088:30"/>thereof: Besides, this Light is diminished by Custom and continuance in Sinning. Through their vain Imaginations, their foolish Hearts are full of Darkness, when they profest themselves to become Wise, they became Fools, <hi>Rom.</hi> xxi. 22. And it is withal in a natural State, as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> declares it was with the <hi>unconverted Gentiles. They walk in the Vanity of their Minds, having their Thoughts darkened, and being Stangers to the Life of God, through the Ignorance that is in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the Hardness of their Heart,</hi> Ephes. iv. 17, 18. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> had but a dim Sight of the Law before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, when he then concluded, That touching the Righteousness of the Law, he was blameless: And at the same time he was not better than his Brethren the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, who were like whited Sepulcres, within full of Rottenness and dead Men's Bones. So that it's plain, that the Light of Nature, yea though assisted too by that that's call'd common Grace, is too dim a Candle to give Light unto the Extent of the Spirituality of the Law of God. Hence it undeniably follows, That the greatest Conviction of Sin by the Law, will not in the least necessitate or drive a Soul from Self to Christ and his Righteousness, one Moment afore there is a saving Discovery made of a Crucified Christ to the Soul.</p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:51088:30"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. To this the Experiences of Saints give in their joint concurrent Suffrages. This they can experience concerning all Sinners that they are acquainted with: That the strongest Convictions in them have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either in a little Reformation; or else (if the Conscience could be mastered) in a worse Debauchery; so far have they been from necessitating of them to fly to Christ. This also they experienced in themselves before Conversion; for though many of them have had great and strong Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for Sin; yet they never sought out after Christ and his Righteousness, 'till Christ sought them first, that sought him not: But they only sought to pacify their Consciences by their Reformation and better Obedience, and went no further than Self for Healing, <hi>Hos.</hi> v. 13. <hi>When</hi> Ephraim <hi>saw his Sickness and</hi> Judah <hi>his wound; then went</hi> Ephraim <hi>unto</hi> Ashur <hi>and sent to King</hi> Jareb; <hi>yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your Wound.</hi> Thus poor Sinners, when they see their Sickness in a natural State, go to their own Works, (which are Physicians of no Value) for Cure; though their own Righteousness cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly heal them. From all this 'tis abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifest, that the greatest Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Law in a State of Nature, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in the least move or incline a Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Christ, nor in the least prepare or fit a Soul for the Reception of Christ. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:51088:31"/> 2dly, I shall demonstrate, That at the first coming of Supernatural Grace, the Law itself in the Conscience discovers Sin to the Soul after another Manner than afore. I shall make it good from Scripture, Reason, and Experience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> From positive Places of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. the Apostle describes the Effects of the Law upon the Conscience, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after Conversion. How the Law operates in the Conscience before Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, is declared in the Beginning of the Chapter, and how after Conversion, in the latter Part of the Chapter. And it appears, that before Conversion it comes not in with the Spirituality. The Apostle himself is an Instance: He understood the Law, liv'd upon it as well as any Man; and yet in his natural state, he did conclude, <hi>That as touching the Righteousness of the Law, he was blameless,</hi> Philip. iii. 6. But when his Eyes were opened by Grace, he judged now otherwise concerning the Law, and himself as coming up to it, so that he cryed out, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 24. <hi>O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver me from this Body of Death?</hi> Likewise, Verse 24. he declares That he and other Believers saw now more into the Law, than they did before Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus he says; <hi>For we know that the Law is Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. To me there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears an Emphasis to be in the Word <hi>We; For (we) know,</hi> i. e. We that believe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51088:31"/>know, <hi>that the Law is spiritual.</hi> To be sure none does so discern the Spirituality of the Law, as Believers do. Thus again, our blessed Master <hi>Jesus</hi> expounds the Law above what the great Lawyers of that Day did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 6, and 7th Chapters: It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that they with all their Studying and Improving of their natural Light, went but little further than the Letter thereof: But Christ expounded it Spiritually, and always makes a Contradiction between their Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions and his. He spake thus concerning their Expositors and Preachers, both mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern and ancient, <hi>Matth.</hi> v. 21. <hi>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, you shall not kill; and whosoever kills, shall be in danger of the Judgment.</hi> This he more Spiritually and more fully explains in his Exposition, Verse 22. <hi>But I say unto you, whosoever is angry with his Brother, without cause, shall be in danger of the Judgment; and whosoever shall say to his Brother,</hi> Raca, <hi>shall be in danger of the Councel; but whosoever shall say, thou Fool, shall be in danger of Hell Fire.</hi> Thus 27, 28 Verses; compare also 31, 32. again 33, and 34, with 43, 44. He Prefaces his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Exposition of the Law, with these Words; <hi>But, I say unto you:</hi> Which is very remarkable, and to me clearly intimates thus much; That it is the Gospel discovers the Law to <hi>Fallen Man,</hi> in its full Extent and Spirituality, when the Grace of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51088:32"/>Gospel seizes the Soul; then the Law itself appears more Spiritual, and in a larger Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the Conscience. I shall add thereto some Arguments to confirm the Truth.</p>
                  <p>There is a two-fold encrease of Light in reference to the Law, at the coming of Grace to the Soul.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>An Encrease of an Objective Light.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. — <hi>Of a Subjective Light.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. The Gospel which declares and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals the Righteousness of Christ, (which was the answering the Demands of the Law in his active and passive Obedience) to be so perfect, so full and compleat; does thereby declare and reveal, how high, great, and perfect the Demands of the Law are. The Length and Breadth of Christ's Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness, do sufficiently evince the Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Commandment: None but he by his compleat Obedience thereto, and suffering the Penalty thereof, <hi>could magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Law, and make it honourable,</hi> Isa. xlii. 21. His suffering so great a Death to satisfy its Penalty, and his paying so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat an Obedience to honour its Exaction, did more glorify the Purity and Perfection of God's Law, than if <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Race had stood and obeyed it always. And when the Spirit of Grace through the Righteousness of Christ comes to make out this to the Conscience in working saving
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51088:32"/>Faith; that Conscience is made to see more clearly into the Spirituality and Extent of it than afore. And thus as the Apostle says, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. ult. <hi>We through Faith do not make void the Law, but establish it;</hi> So that when Grace comes to reign through the Righteousness of Christ upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, there is an encrease made of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Light in reference to the Law.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There's an Improvement of our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is the Light of Nature improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed highly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There shines also in the Soul a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Light, and both these give Light to the Law as well as to Grace, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Disease as well as the Remedy. There's an improvement of natural Light, in the Illumination of the Spirit, though common: This is intimated in <hi>Heb.</hi> vi. 4. But this supernatural Light is described to be the <hi>Eyes of the Understanding, being enlightned by the Spirit of Wisdom and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in the Knowledge of him,</hi> Ephes. xvii. 18. So that every one that does Evil, and is in a natural State hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light, (as appears by the Context) that is as it flashes into na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Conscience, for Christ giveth the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Light objectively. And he is the Giver of it subjectively. And if he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51088:33"/>gives it but by awakening natural Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by his Gospel, Men fly from it, <hi>least their Deeds should be reproved,</hi> or <hi>disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,</hi> John iii. 20. Whence observe, there is no true Discovery of Sin, 'till we come under Christ's Illumination; for he is the <hi>True Light:</hi> For <hi>in him we have Life,</hi> if we have it, and even he is the Light of Men in natural Conscience, <hi>Lightning every Man that comes into the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This will yet be more manifest by Experience: And Believers if they care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend to the Motions of their Souls, may observe these Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They that are Conversant with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, can tell you, That there was a Time, when the greatest Conviction of Sin set them upon the Satisfying the Law by their own Obedience; but they were afterward on a sudden made to see, that their own Obedience would not do, but that they must look out to the Righteousness of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and whence it arose, Men saw not this? It was from a slight Esteem they had of the Demands of the Law: But since the coming of Grace, they were made to have such an honourable Esteem of the Law, and its Demands; that they are looking for a better Obedience than their own to pay to it by way of Satisfaction. Again,</p>
                  <p>They can experience this also: That there was a Time when they heal'd their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science with a little Reformation: But now
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51088:33"/>the Sense of their Sin and Misery is so abounding, that unless they have a great Faith wrought in them at first, and great Sealings from the Holy Spirit; their Wounds are kept continually bleeding, though not without Hopes. Ask them what they ail; they will tell you, <hi>That they hunger and thirst after the Righteousness of Christ,</hi> Matth. v. 6. and nothing short of the sensible Application thereof to their Conscience will satisfy them; though they are somewhat reliev'd with the Hopes they have of looking to, and leaning on it; yet nothing can so fully satisfy them, 'till this Righteousness is so fully applied to them, that they can say, it is theirs. This also proceeds from those strong and immediate Convictions of the Law in the Conscience, of their Sinfulness and Misery; resulting from the saving Discoveries of the Remedy. Hence it is, that those that are savingly convinc'd, cry out more and more constantly of their undone and lost Condition, than others in a natural State do under the strongest Convictions, though their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are not so wrack'd and tortured as theirs; nor do their Spirits boil up with Rage and Enmity against God as theirs do: And this springs from the same Cause. But again.</p>
                  <p>Saints do Experience this also: That when they walk closest with Christ, and look to, and lean most on his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51088:34"/>their Consciences are then most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about Sin, and are soonest brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Guilt for the least Sin. But when Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers themselves cease to converse with Christ and his Righteousness; Convictions of Sin, are not so frequent in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: Then many Sins are past by without Observation, or if observ'd, little regarded. The Cause of this to me, seems to be, That the good old righteous Law of God, being by God's Ordination set up in the Believer's Conscience a perfect Rule of Life; The more the Believer deals with Christ and his Grace, as he receives thereby the more Power to conform to this Rule, so a greater Light into the Rule. Every Act of Faith in Christ reflects within, and irradiates on the Rule also. This Rule as a streight Line by the Light of Grace, discovers itself, and every crookedness. Therefore it must needs be, that a Conscience enlightned powerfully by Grace, must be convinced by it, wherein it comes short of it. And take this Law abstractedly, there is no difference between convincing and condemning, for where it convinces, it condemns. Hence it is, that the choicest Believers are soonest convinc'd, and soonest brought under Guilt. I cannot see with some, how the Law exerts in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, only an exacting Power, and not a condemning Power. There is no separating Convictions from it as a Rule, nor Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from Conviction, if you take it in its
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51088:34"/>own Nature; but it is the Blood and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ removes the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ought to step in, if I may so say, between Conviction and actual Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Sentence. This perfect Law in the more holy Walkers, does more renew its Convictions than in others; and they see a need to be continually making fresh Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Blood of Sprinkling, and the Righteousness of Jesus. So you see, that to believe for Justification, is the Work of our whole Lives, and a Believer never ought to cease putting forth Justifying Acts of Faith. Hence also it follows, the more the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of a Believer pleads by Faith the Blood and Righteousness of Jesus, the more cause he sees to continue his Pleas, which is call'd, the being found and cloathed in and with the Righteousness of Christ. The Cause of this is, the more the Soul believes on Christ, the more Light is in the Soul; and the more Light there is, the more the prefect Rule appears there; the more the prefect Rule appears there in its own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the sooner the Soul is brought under Convictions for the least Deviations from it. If it be so, then in the Experiences of the liveliest Believers, that the more they walk in the Name of Christ, and glory in his Righteousness, the more they are convinc'd of their own Imperfections: And the soonest they are brought under Guilt in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences for the least Sin, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
<pb facs="tcp:51088:35"/>really are most tender. Then it follows, That the greater the Light of Faith in the Exercise is, the more does the Law in the Conscience discover itself as a perfect Rule; and the more it discovers it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as a perfect Rule, it sooner convinces of Sin, and in this Conviction enters Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, which is the Guilt of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Those Believers that have the Skill of Faith instantly to apply the Blood of Jesus to remove this Guilt, rightly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove Faith to step in between Conviction and Condemnation. But they that have not this Skill of Faith, suffer Guilt to rest in the Bosom, 'till it's very bitter to them; and perhaps they grow dark and legal. And hence it is, that some Believers from high Degrees of Faith, and great Communion with Christ fall suddenly under great Guilt and Darkness. The Law appearing very Spiritual in that shining Light they have, convinces of Imperfections, and with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction brings in Condemnation, they not continuing to walk in Christ, and after the Spirit that leads to Pardon, but turning aside to walk after the Flesh, sink in their Souls into Deadness, Darkness, and Distance from God.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of what has been said, amounts to this; That from the Experiences of the Saints, we may safely argue; That the Law in the Light of Grace reigning through the Righteousness of Christ exerts a greater
<pb facs="tcp:51088:35"/>Spirituality in the Conscience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does more fully convince of Sin. And from all this the grand Truth is confirmed, <hi>viz.</hi> That after Grace comes to the Soul, Convictions of Sin by the Law itself are fuller and greater than afore.</p>
                  <p>A third Things that remains to be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is; whether these saving Convictions of Sin and Misery antecede an Act of Faith, whereby we lay hold on Christ. As to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Time, they are somewhat Simulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous: As to order of Nature and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, they precede; forasmuch as the Soul must see its need of Christ e're it can fly to Christ; and there can be no thorough Sight of the Need of Christ, without a thorough Sight of its Misery and lost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Therefore the Case being thus, that a Soul has no thorough Sight of it Self and Miserableness, 'till the Grace of Christ first apprehends the Soul, (as hath been already proved:) And the Soul cannot apprehend Christ without a Conviction of the absolute Necessity of Christ; and the Soul cannot see such a Need of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a thorough Conviction of its Pollution and Misery. Therefore the first saving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction must of necessity intervene in order of Nature at least, between Grace coming to the Soul, and so making of it alive, and the living Soul going forth in Acts of Faith to lay hold on Christ. Therefore for the
<pb facs="tcp:51088:36"/>conceiving of Things aright, we must thus apprehend them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Christ unites himself to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Moment he sends his Spirit to indwell in that Soul. This is the Fruit of Christ's Ascension and Intercession, and the first Application of Christ to the Soul, when he gives himself, it being the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Effect of his Unition. So he says himself, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 16, 17. <hi>that he would pray the Father, and</hi> (says our Lord) <hi>he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,</hi> Ver. 17. <hi>even the Spirit of Truth, — for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That then a living Light is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to the
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 3. How shall he not with him give us all Things. <hi>First,</hi> Christ; <hi>and then all Things with him;</hi> says Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> on that Place.</note> Soul discovering the Remedy, and at the same time the Disease; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing the Excellency of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and the Filthiness of Sin. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 6. compared with <hi>Esa.</hi> v. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By which Light the Soul being made alive, accepts of this Righteousness, and leans upon it, consenting to the Grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. This last is called the Act of Faith; the other the Principle, or Habit of Faith.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51088:36"/>So that with the Principle of Faith, comes in this saving Conviction antecedent in the Order of Nature to the Act of Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we fly to Christ. And hence it is, That the Soul seeing the Remedy, and the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease at one time; by the Excellency of the Remedy discovered is drawn, and by the Sight of the loathsomness of Sin, and its Danger, is compell'd and necessitated to fly to Christ. The Perswasions of the Security of the City of Refuge, and the Sound of the Avenger of Blood at the Heels, did cause the Soul to fly thereto with all speed. The Angels taking <hi>Lot</hi> by the Hand out of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and the Report of the dismal Fire to come down, made him linger no longer; tho' afore the Angels took him by the Hand, the terrible Report could not make him stir a Foot. Hence it is, that it's true what's alledged, That a Soul must see its need of Christ, before it can fly to Christ; and must be convinced of its Sinfulness and Misery, before it can see its need of Christ; and this by the Law too. The Soul must be drawn by the Father, and drawn with the Cords of Grace; and in a sense driven by the Law too; but yet the State is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ's actual uniting him self to the Soul in Order of Nature, before any of this can be done; though all these Things be at the same Time in the Soul.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:51088:37"/>
                  <p> Thus I have discover'd my Judgment in this Matter, according to the present Light I have in a Controversy, which has made so much Noise in the World. If any be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, I should be glad (if in the Spirit of Meekness) they would give me better Information. I confess I am very jealous of giving way to such Principles, as may suppose any Spiritual Life in the Soul, before reigning Grace comes; whilst the Soul is in a State of Nature, and dead in Trespasses and Sins. And for the further clearing of my Mind in this Matter, I shall propose some Objections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. Does not God always lay hold on a Soul by his Grace, when the Soul is then in a natural State, under the Terrors and Convictions of the Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Res.</hi> I do think in the Dispensation of his Grace, since the Recovery from the <hi>Romish Apostacy,</hi> he has often Times followed that Method, (tho' not always;) suitable to the Preaching of his Servants, that had not, nor have yet rub'd off all Darkness of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christianism.</hi> But 'tis clear from his Word, a Day will come, wherein he will very much vary from that Method; and seize ignorant and secure Sinners, by his Grace, in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the Heighth of their Ignorance and Security, for to honour the Excellency of the Power of his Sovereign Grace, as he did <hi>Zacheus, Paul,</hi> and others, <hi>Isa.</hi> lxvi. 8.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51088:37"/>The sudden Conversion of so many Jews under <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, and their being added to the Church the self same Day, was but a transfigur'd Glory of that which shall be upon Conversion, when this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy comes to be fully accomplished.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. What Reasons can be assign'd for that Method of his, to take up Sinners by his Grace, when sunk almost to the Pit of Despair, by the Terrors of the Law?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Res.</hi> He gives no Account of his Matters: But no doubt, his Reasons were, some way or other, for the advancing and endearing of his glorious Grace. A Ship that has escaped the Storm, prizes the Harbour the more. One that has escap'd the Chains of Captivity sets a higher esteem on the Princely Palace. Besides, under despair, the Enmity of the corrupt Part will fight most against Grace; and the greater the Enmity is, that then is stiring in the Soul, in the Moment of the Conquest of Grace, renders the Victory of Grace the more illustrious; beside many other Reasons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. But is not the Soul, with such Convictions, prepared to fly to Christ?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Res.</hi> I do not know what is meant by this Word (prepare) if it be meant, that the Soul, by such Convictions, is made more able and willing to receive Grace, when it comes, I utterly deny it. But I shall not much
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:51088:38"/>contend, if there be meant some other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, as when the Remedy hath taken hold, that antecedent Sight of Sickness may contribute then to the Soul, seeing its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute need of the Remedy. But here I must also add, That the Conviction of Sin and Misery, that comes in with the saving Manifestation of the Remedy, out-does the Former, as the Light of the Sun the Light of the Stars; and as the Stars disappear when the Sun arises; so these antecedent legal Convictions probably may be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the latter saving Convictions. Yet I shall not much dispute this Matter, provided a Distinction be made between those saving Convictions which belong only to the Elect, and that when savingly called; and those Convictions that the Reprobates may have, and yet go to Hell. And also provided this sort of Repentance or any other, be not made the Conditions of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. To sum up all; I think this is sufficient to prove, that in a believing Look to a Crucified Jesus, there comes in a far greater Light from the Law itself, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Man's Sinfulness and Misery. And thus from the Arguments that have been drawn from Comparison, and from the Spirituality of the Law exerted in the Conscience, in and by the Light of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace, this great Truth hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. That the only Glass to have a full and thorough Sight of Sin in, is the Glass
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51088:38"/>of a Crucified Jesus. I shall now make some improvement thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. Let it be for a Use of Exhortation to Saints.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To value the Death and Satisfaction of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To converse with it, and improve it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Set a high Esteem on the Death of Christ. Give it its due Honour and Value; for in honouring the Undertakings of Christ, you honour him; and <hi>in honouring him, you honour the Father also,</hi> Joh. v. 23. The contrary is to despise, and tread under Foot the Blood of the everlasting Covenant: Have a care therefore of those Things that shall make you have slighting Thoughts of the Righteousness of Christ.</p>
                  <p>That, that makes us slight the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ in our Consciences, is the want of a due Conviction of Sin; and that arises, as has been shewn, from the not abiding in the constant Views of this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. The more we look by Faith to the Blood of Christ, the more tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scienc'd we are in point of Sinning, and the more Notice we take of the least Sin, the sooner are we convinc'd and brought under guilt; and the more we are convinc'd of Sin, the more cause we see to fly to, and value this Righteousness; when we come
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51088:39"/>to see that our best Thoughts are mixt with Sin and Imperfections, and are under the guilt and sense thereof; we then see a necessity of making constant use of it, and therefore constantly to admire and esteem this Righteousness. We always practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dis-esteem the Righteousness of Christ, when we entertain favourable thoughts of Sin. These following bad Principles have a strong tendency to lessen Sin, and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the Blood of Christ in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> When we judge that the perfect law of God is not a rule for the walk of Believers. That will make Sin to appear no Sin; for we may be soon tempted to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, if we be under no Law, we may live as we list, and our Transgressions be no Evils: For, where there is no Law, there is no Transgression.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is a bad Principle, and an Enemy to the Righteousness of Christ; that we are to expect the greatest Blessings upon our degrees of Obedience, tho' they be Sinful and Imperfect; for thereby the Soul will be tempted to value its own Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience above the obedience of Christ, and to esteem its own Performances beyond the Death and Satisfaction of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. For when the Soul is perswaded that it must be beholden to its own sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for all the Blessings of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; it sees no such need to be beholden
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51088:39"/>to the active and passive Obedience of Christ, and consequently not so much to value it. A proud Heart will take the least occasion to over-look his God-like Righteousness, that it might glory in its own; (I appeal to your Experiences, O Believers, if you don't find much of this in your Hearts:) Sin and Imperfection also must needs be slighted, when the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is possest of this; that sinful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Obedience may be the Condition of these invaluable spiritual Blessings.</p>
                  <p>A third Principle like to this is: That God accepts the Will for the Deed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we and our Performances are <hi>accepted only in the beloved,</hi> Ephes. i. 6. It was a Prophesy of Gospel-days, <hi>That Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and their Duties should find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on God's Altar,</hi> Isa. lx. 7. It was by Faith that look'd to another for Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that <hi>Abel offered to God a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifice than Cain,</hi> Heb. xi. 4. God is so far from accepting the Will for the Deed, that he accepts neither Will nor Deed, but in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> 'Tis mistaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly founded on Rom. vii. 15, 18, 19, 21. Those places only tell you, what inherent Holiness is, as opposed by inherent Pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not how or where this inherent Holiness is accepted: If Preachers had spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually and truly understood the two first Verses of the 8th Chapter, they would have been taught, that the acceptance of their
<pb facs="tcp:51088:40"/>Holiness is only in another, and the Law of their Spirit of life in him, which as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the law of Sin and Death in us, is the alone Ground, with its relation to the Person and Priesthood of Jesus Christ, that our imperfect Holiness is accepted by a most pure and holy God. Therefore I take it to be a horrible Principle, and adapted to make People trust in themselves, that God accepts of their willingness to Obey, instead of Obedience. When once a Soul is persuaded that acceptance with God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on his own Will, it swells up that poor Soul to glory in itself, and to despise the Righteousness of Christ, in which alone we and our deeds are accepted, and has a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to overthrow our living unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; if so be some good wishes of ours may not only pass instead of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but purchase the favour of God for us.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Principle that makes Believers think Sin harmless, and slight the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Christ, is this; that Believers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compleatly Justified in the first Act of Saving Faith, need not put forth after acts for Justification; but that they may pacify Conscience with this; that they find, by certain marks and signs, that they are God's Children; and, as such, may conclude, their Sins are the spots of God's Children: and therefore they need be no further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned about them. This undeniably is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51088:40"/>true, that Justification is compleated at first; but then, the sense of it in our Consciences, is not so compleated; and 'tis required of us, that we plead this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, or Justification at God's Bar al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and that we oppose this justifying Righteousness to all the Accusations of Law and Satan in the Conscience. Hence it is, that it is our Business every moment to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Justification, that we may <hi>keep the Conscience clean, and purged from dead Works,</hi> Heb. ix. 13. whereby we see an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity of having constant recourse continually to the Righteousness of Jesus; and so be obliged to set an high esteem and value upon it.</p>
                  <p>The Fifth Reason why our Spiritual Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are cooled to the Righteousness of Christ, is; because we do not see its bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and excellency. We are not convinc'd, and persuaded in our Consciences, that it is a compleat and perfect Righteousness, of an Infinite, Eternal, and Unchangeable Value, Virtue and Dignity: Because we do not believe and see the inestimable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this God like Righteousness, Man's Teaching, besides corrupt fleshly Wisdom has been persuading us, that our Act of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, is the same with God's Act of Imputation, or at least that our Act is greater for our Advantage than God's, as being casually influential into God's Act of Imputation? hence it is, that we have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51088:41"/>such a practical dis-esteem of it. Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear we should exalt this Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in Expressions becoming his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Glory, though they be Spiritual ones. They, as Satan's Instruments, would darken this Grace of God; and Satan well knows, if he can keep us off from a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Communion with this Righteousness which is at God's Right Hand, where Christ is; he then shall not only rob us of our Comforts, but hinder us in our Holy Walk. He knows this well enough, that nothing carries on the Work of Sanctification, as Justifying Faith in continual exercise.</p>
                  <p>The Sixth Reason why we do so practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally slight the Righteousness of Christ, is this; That we have very mean thoughts of God's Act of Imputation. We do not stedfastly believe that his Righteousness is so made ours, as the Word of God expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it. We think it is the Righteousness of another wholly without us; and, through Pride of Heart, we must have something sensibly of our own to commend us. If our own Grace be the Hand that holds this Shield, we glory more in the Hand, than the Shield that covers us. We are apt to think this Righteousness is gone to Heaven; and it is too great a self emptying to have recourse thither to it continually. And we are apt to think in our Consciences, that we must substitute our own Righteousness as <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,</hi> in its Room on Earth, to procure all
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51088:41"/>sense of Favour, and Peace of Conscience. We deal with our own Righteousness, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dealt with <hi>Joseph,</hi> who set him over all the Land, though under himself; and when the People cried to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he sent them to <hi>Joseph.</hi> So we are apt to send our Consciences to our own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for every thing, as the Vice-gerent of the Righteousness of God which is by Faith. All this while we allow the Righteousness of Christ to possess the Throne, only there it shall sit neglected. Ah! but this is a Complementing way to dethrone imputed Righteousness; and, as of old, cry, Hail Master; kiss, and betray it.</p>
                  <p>And, Seventhly. This also has a Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to create a light esteem of imputed Righteousness; even our slowness of heart to believe the great and glorious Priviledges of the Saints as vested with it. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture says, <hi>They are all fair, glorious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out spot or wrinkle,</hi> Cant. iv. 7. <hi>or Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, or any such Thing,</hi> Ephes. v. 27. <hi>And without Fault before the Throne,</hi> Rev. xiv. 5. — i. 6. (as wrapt round with this infinite Righteousness) so they are said to be made <hi>Kings and Priests; Called Heirs of God, and Joint Heirs with Jesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. viii. 17. With unspeakable other Privileges, as they are made perfect thro' the comeliness of the Righteousness of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus. When Souls have some glimpse of this by Faith, How do they value and admire
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:51088:42"/>this Righteousness? How do they renounce all Self, yea the best of Self, that they may be <hi>found cloathed with it?</hi> Phil. iii. 8. and they count every thing but dross, and Dogs-meat in comparison of it: But when through the darkness of Unbelief, they cannot see into these Glorious Privileges, then they have not that value for the Blood of Christ as afore. A View by Faith of these transcendant Privileges is so far from tempting the Soul to loosness, that nothing does more constrain the Soul to a Holy Walk. Satan is not ignorant of this, when he stirs up the Tongues and Pens of Men, that are Drunk with their own carnal Wisdom, to vilify and ridicule those Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges belonging to Believers, that result from the Imputation of this God-like Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; yet they cannot out-do Satan by his private Suggestions to the Soul; and when he can thereby prevail with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to be shy of those Blessings that the Word of God declares belong to them, whose Sins are covered; he soon prevails with them to despise the precious Blood of the Lamb of God. Because of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned things and others, the Soul, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the clearest notions of imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, comes to loath this Spiritual Manna, to cry out, <hi>What must we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this light Bread?</hi> And so va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the Onions and Garlick, and the Flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51088:42"/>of <hi>Egypt</hi> beyond it: But oh Believers! Suffer me to renew my Exhortations to you.</p>
                  <p>Have a care of a practical undervaluing of the Death and Blood of Christ, That you may do so, take heed of entertaining in your Consciences those dark and destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Maxims as have been mentioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they come in from the Pulpit, Press, or private Discourses, or Satan's private Suggestions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exh.</hi> II. Always look, and always lean upon that Righteousness, which <hi>is above at God's right Hand, where Christ is,</hi> Colos. iii. 1. <hi>If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those Things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right Hand of God.</hi> Vers. 2. <hi>Set your Affections on Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, and not on Things on the Earth.</hi> Be like <hi>the Merchants-ship, that brings her Food from far,</hi> Prov. xxxi. 14. Thus let your Conversation be in Heaven, beholding and putting on this Righteousness every Moment of the Day: Dwell in the light of this shining Righteousness, that you may see your Self and Sin more thoroughly; and stand upon your Watch against every Sin of a Thought, and the least act of Unbelief; that you may still rise higher and higher in your esteem of, and application to that Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Son of God. Look unto a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Jesus, that you might hate, and loath, and be sick of Sin, and so love the Blood of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51088:43"/>Jesus. — And now a word of Exhortation to poor Sinners.</p>
                  <p>Oh you poor miserable Wretches! suffer you also a Word of Exhortation. I exhort you, the vilest of you, to look unto a Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified Jesus, lifted upon the Bloody Cross, as the Serpent was lifted up by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness. I say look unto him, by seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Consideration, that you may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of your odious Pollution, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Misery. Behold your own foul Face in that Glass, and read the Hell your Sins deserve in that Book. Look to a bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jesus, O blind! that ye may see,</hi> Isa. xlii. 18. Hear the Story of Eternal Love in his wounded sides, that ye may hear. A Jesus lifted upon the Cross <hi>is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for a light to the Gentiles,</hi> Isa. xlii. 18. — xlix. 6. Even to the worst of Sinners, <hi>to open their blind Eyes.</hi> And 'tis he thus <hi>lifted up, that draws all Men unto him,</hi> John xii. 32. Sinners, I bespeak you, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der four ranks, to look to him whom Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities have pierced and wounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> You Sinners, that are horribly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd, and yet secure; consider, 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Story of Jesus, as recorded in the Bible, and as Preach'd in the World, be true or not? 2. Whether this doth not concern the vilest of Sinners? 3. Whether it doth not concern you as such? And let
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51088:43"/>this awaken your Attentions to consider what's spoken concerning this Lamb of God being made an Offering for Sin: Thus let me summon your Attention; and whilst you attend, who knows but a supernatural Light may break in upon your dark Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, to discover to you your Disease and Remedy together; Or, at least, it may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken the Law of God in your Consciences. For this is found to be experimentally true in Preaching; that the Exaltation of a Crucified Jesus puts a Soul under more le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal awakenings, than the Thunderings of the Law does.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. You vile debauch'd Sinners, that have frequent gripes of Conscience; let me Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you also to look out for a thorough Conviction of your State, Peace of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and Power against your Corruptions, from a believing view of a Crucified Jesus. The reason why you return, as Dogs to your Vomit of Filthiness, after so many Convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is, because your Convictions have not not been thorough. That they may be so, behold your odious Sins in the Glass of this great Sacrifice of Atonement. Look unto him that Sin has bruised; and then you'll mourn for, loath, and forsake your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and never rightly before. Your Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions will be still too mighty for you, unless you subdue them in that Blood that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51088:44"/>cleanses from all Sin. Sin is rightly to be slain on the slain Lamb of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. And you Self-justitiaries; who have quite choak'd your Consciences with your own doings; hear you also the Voice of the Son of God. <hi>Hearken you stout-hearted that are far from Righteousness,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a <hi>crucified Jesus, bringing his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness near,</hi> Isa. xlvi. 12. Compare your Righteousness, and your Works with the Righteousness of Jesus, and by the Spirit of Jesus; and you'll quickly see <hi>they will not profit you,</hi> Isa. lvii. 12. and apprehend your own to be but Dross and Dung. Weigh them together in the Ballance of the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, and you'll find your own altogether lighter than Vanity. If you take a view of the excellency of his Righteousness, you'll soon see your self, as well as your Sin, to be Odious and Abominable. Were ever your Works and Deeds in Heaven, in the Bosom of the Father? but Jesus has been there. Did they ever come down from Heaven? But Jesus came from thence. Are they Innocent and Perfect? But Jesus was Holy, Harmless, and Undefiled, and so was his Death and Obedience. Are they Infinite, Eternal, Unchangeable? but the Redeemer is so in his Obedience and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Did your good Heart, your Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, your Good-deeds (as you call them)
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51088:44"/>ever bear the weight of Divine Vengeance? Did they Suffer? Did they Bleed? Did they Die? Or were they nailed to the Cross? Did they make full Attonement and Satisfaction? But Jesus has done and suffered all these. And yet will you offer to put up your own good Meanings, and good Deeds, in the room of Christ, and his Righteousness, to obtain for you eternal Glory, Acceptance, Peace of Conscience, and Evangelical Holiness. If you look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Crucified Jesus, and if God help you to look aright, you will see your best of Doings to be but filthy Rags, your own Covering too narrow for you; your State, though white-wash'd, yet still polluted; and you have inward Rottenness, for all your outward Paint.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. Hear me also, you Sinners, that are still working for Life, yet cannot quiet your Consciences; yet place still your Hopes upon your own Works and Inventions; who, as fast as Convictions grieve your Consciences, stifle all, by finding <hi>your Life by your own Doings,</hi> Isa. lvii. 10. Ah! let me tell you, 'tis in vain to quiet Conscience with any Thing short of the Righteousness of Christ. No other Salve can heal the Burning Wounds thereof, but the Blood of God; and if you mix any Thing of your own with that Salve, it will not stick to the Wound; if you should make a shift to stick it here, it
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51088:45"/>will certainly drop off, as soon as you enter Eternity. I know this is the Stumbling-Block in your Way; you would have a full Conviction before you look to Christ. But the Way of the Gospel is to look to Christ, for a full, saving, and thorough Conviction of Sin, as has been already proved. If you are resolved never to eye Christ till you are fully convinc'd of Sin first; you may stick there and perish, and never see Sin as you would, till you see Sin in Hell on yourselves, through the Glass of Divine Vengeance, as your eternal Wrack and Torture. But if you would have a right Sight of Sin, see Sin appearing on a dying satisfying Jesus. I speak to you all in the Language of the Gospel; Come as you are, poor, vile, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Sinners to Christ, to behold him dying for Sinners as such. 'Tis certain, when he died for Sinners, he considered them only in the Heighth of their Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, to encourage Sinners, as Sinners, to come unto him. Whil<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> he bore our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, did he consider our Obedience or Honour, we should bring him here? No; Did he consider Sinners as glorifying him in Heaven? No; in the Heighth of his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for them, he considered them in the Heighth of their Rebellion, <hi>Rom.</hi> v. 8. <hi>But God commendeth his Love towards us, that while we were yet Sinners Christ died for us.</hi> There is an eminent Instance of it in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51088:45"/>the 2d of the <hi>Acts:</hi> 'Tis conceived most of them converted then, were some way or other concern'd in his Murder. Many of them (as it's thought) were amongst them, which cryed, <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him,</hi> and stirred up the Romish Magistrates to the greatest Rage. Some of them spat on him, some blasphemed him and mock'd him. And yet all this while he was Suffering for them, while he saw their Fury, heard their Blasphemy, felt their Cruelty: He was then atoning for their Cruelty and Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; He cryed out, <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do,</hi> Luke xxiii. 34. And as an Effect of that Prayer, Those were afterwards converted. Suppose, you, O Sinners, had been among them when they had been <hi>pricked in their Consciences;</hi> You might perhaps have heard them cry out; Ah, wretch as I am! Did he suffer for mine Iniquities in smiting him? And another; Did he satisfy for my Blasphemy that moment I was Blaspheming him? What a filthy Wretch was I? And a third; Did he make Atonement for my Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then, when I was actually Persecuting of him, crying <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But suppose again, Poor Sinners, if you had all liv'd in that Day, and stood about the Cross, and shook your Heads and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil'd him, and had cryed out with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51088:46"/>Rabble: There hangs a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, a licentious <hi>Antinomian;</hi> and then would have insulted over him with their blasphemous Language; You with your great Faith there, where is your Faith now? come down from the Cross, if your Faith be so great. And whilst you had been act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus; suppose one that you would have credited, had come and discours'd you thus, Do you know who it is that suffers here? whom it is that you thus revile and taunt over? 'Tis the beloved Son of the Father; the great <hi>Emanuel;</hi> the Saviour of Sinners; the Prince of Life that there suffers, and that you thus deride? Would nothing (think you) have made you hold your Tongues with Confusion, and draw back with Shame. But suppose he should have gone on, and said: <hi>'Tis for the Sins of the Enemies and Rebels, yea, for the very Blasphemy of this blasphemous Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that he now suffers all these Things.</hi> Imagine you how this would have astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, and made you loath Sin and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, as much as you was taken with it before. But suppose he should have added to every one of you in particular, <hi>It is for thee; yea, it is thy Sorrows that he bare; 'Tis for thy Transgressions he is thus wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; 'tis for thine Iniquities he is thus bruis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He is now bearing the Vengeance due to thy Cruelty, whilst thou art acting it:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51088:46"/>His Love and Pity to thee are such, that he is now satisfying his Father's Justice for thy wicked Speeches, whilst thou art pouring them out before him.</hi> You may suppose how this, laid home by the Spirit, would have melted each of you down, and made you have abhorr'd your selves and Sin in Dust and Ashes; even in Tears and confusion of Face. It would have made each of you cry out, <hi>What, for me! What, suffer for me! What for such a Rebel as I! What, suffer for me, who have such a Hand in his Sufferings!</hi> Here is Love in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Here's sounding of Bowels to Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose! Oh, my Sin! That detested Thing! What a Monster art thou! O Sins, how do I loath you! How do I abhor myself in Dust in Ashes! Though you did not live then, yet you may still take a turn by Faith about the bloody Cross, and present by Faith to your Soul the same cruel Tragedy acted over again. Call back by Faith his Sufferings of almost seventeen hundred Years ago, to the time present. Meditate on the Lord of Glory hanged upon the Tree, bearing all the Weight of that Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance as has been afore-mentioned. Then let thy Conscience ask the Question, What was it for? And let it receive this Answer, It was for Sin, but not for his own, but for the Sin of others. Then let thy Conscience, O Sinner enquire, Who was it for? And
<pb facs="tcp:51088:47"/>be thus Answered again; It was for the worst and vilest of Sinners. And then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon thy Self, and say in thine Heart, If for the worst and vilest of Sinners; I can be but the worst and vilest; then why not for me? I must accept of his Death and Satisfaction, as freely offered, or else be damn'd for ever. Then why may not I in the strength of Christ venture my Soul on his Death and Obedience? If there be no other way of Salvation; where then shall I go but to a Crucified Jesus? Is this the Effect of boundless love to the vilest of Enemies? I am not worse than the vilest, and why not to me? Was this great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction so compleatly paid for the worst of Sinners? And is it now so freely offered to the worst of Sinners? And as such are they commanded to accept of it in the All suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Power coming down from Christ? I can be no more than the worst and most impotent of Sinners; then why may not I in his Strength lay hold on this offered Grace, if offered so infinitely free to Sinners, as Sinners, that have not the least Farthing to pay to entitle them to it; then I that am so miserable, poor and naked; why may not I accept of it? I must Accept, or Reject; and shall I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the only Remedy so freely offered? And farther, Poor Sinner, if the Spirit shall give thee to see thy Sin in particular laid
<pb facs="tcp:51088:47"/>on this Crucified Jesus: How will it make thee loath and forsake thy particular Sins? It is a great Mistake to think or assert, that the vilest of Sinners being made to believe with the Faith of God's Elect, that their Sins are laid on Christ, it will encourage them to go on in Sin. That notorious Sinner, mentioned in the 7th of <hi>Luke,</hi> is an undeniable Instance to the contrary: She was a notorious Sinner, a most filthy Wretch; and as such, made to receive Free Grace. The Scripture says, <hi>She wept, and did much, because she loved much:</hi> And, <hi>she loved much, because much was forgiven her.</hi> Thou shalt be help'd in thy Conscience real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to say, Is this! O, is this the havock my Sins have made on the Innocent Lord of Glory? Was it for Sins he was thus Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For my Blasphemy? For my Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness? For my Swearing? For my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath breaking? Were these Sins of mine that lay so heavy on a Dying Jesus? O, then farewel loathed and detested Sin! Farewel Drunkenness; farewel Sabbath-breaking; farewel Vanity, and all the rest of my bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Morsels that I used to rowl with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure under my Tongue. <hi>Poor Sinners!</hi> Ah, <hi>poor miserable Sinners!</hi> Let me invite you in my Master's Name; in the Woeing Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of my Dying Lord; in the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of his Precious and Godlike Blood. Go by Faith to the Cross; behold the Lord of Heaven slain for Sin; and look on the boundless Bowels of Pity sounding through
<pb facs="tcp:51088:48"/>his wounded Sides! Behold Eternal and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing Love and Grace, begging thee, thou vilest of Sinners to accept of it! Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love in the Language of Blood and Death, and dying Groans, intreating of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to believe that in those pierced Hands and Feet, God is Reconciled to them; and so to believe on, until they feel their Enmity melt away, and so to submit to Free, Rich, Glorious Grace Reigning thro' that Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, tinctur'd with his own Blood, flowing through those bleeding Sides; 'till they feel they are overcome by Grace; and that because of its Infinite Fulness and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Is there any Swearer, Curser, or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaker here? Come and behold a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jesus. Come stand under the Cross, and see the Dimensions of Love to Sinners in his Death. View what fulness of Pardoning Grace by him is purchased. And behold the cruel and cursed Nature of Sin, in what it did un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him when it met upon him on the Tree.</p>
                  <p>Now I leave what has been said to the Blessing of the Lord, though I never see your Faces more: A Testimony has been born for the Lord Jesus. Whether you look on him, or whether you forbear, <hi>A Crucified Jesus has been evidently set forth among you,</hi> Gal. iii. 1. And if you despise Jesus the Crucified Son of God, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his precious Blood of the Covenant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Foot: It must be said to you, as it was to them of old: <hi>Behold, ye Dispisers and Wonder and Perish,</hi> Acts xiii. 41.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>INstead of an Epistle Dedicatory, I shall only briefly acquaint thee with the Reasons that induced me to Print these Sermons: And why they came forth so long after they were Preached. I have sometimes ceased to be a Friend to the Press and never intended to Print them at all, though often put upon to do it: But the Lord, the Redeemer, whose Blessing and Power made Clay and Spittle to open the Eyes of the Blind, was pleased to own these so, as to make them of great Use to several. Their Entreaty, with divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, prevailed with the Widdow of the Deceased, to importune me further, so that her Importunity join'd with theirs, obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, at least to redeem (when I could) now and then a little time from the great Work of Christ, that is upon my
<pb facs="tcp:51088:50"/>Hands, to set them in order, and so venture them into the World. There fell in also another cogent Motive,</hi> viz. <hi>The Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the false and lying Stories scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered through City and Country concerning me and the Doctrines I Preach, made me willing to let all know (if they please to read) what those Doctrines are, and so they may make a better Judgment afterwards. And I do assure thee these Sermons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the chief Substance of what I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here in the Country: Therefore I have made some Additions hereunto, and Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions suitable to my main Scope in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Year past. Had the Men of the World only cast Dirt, it would have been more tolerable. Better could not have been expected from them, but to act according to their Nature. But this has been pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Truths of Jesus have been wounded in the House of Friends. Here a sufficient Occasion is given for a pathetick Lamentation;</hi> But tell it not in <hi>Gath,</hi> and publish it not in <hi>Askelon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Whatever Blows some aim at one another, they all fall upon their holy Profession, whilst a too eager Vindication is pursued of our good Names and Reputation from undue and unjust Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51088:50"/>The Name of Jesus and his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel may be exposed to a greater Reproach. This made me choose to lie still with a Gag in my Mouth, whilst I was, and am still cloathed with</hi> Sambanettoes, <hi>than use the Methods I might to assert my wronged In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, leaving it to God, the Judge of all, to vindicate his Name and Gospel in his due time, and in his own way (which I am certain he will.) And as for me, let my Name lie in the Dust, provided it may make for the Honour of Christ, and the Furtherance of his Gospel. I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to learn this Lesson, to</hi> rejoice in Reproaches <hi>from whatever Tongues they come) as well as in</hi> Infirmities for Christ's Sake; <hi>and I would press after that meek Spirit of the Gospel; that</hi> being defamed to intreat, <hi>viz. To intreat Christ on the Behalf of my Defamers, and entreat them in the Bowels of Mercy to lay aside their Enmity against the Lord Jesus his Truth and Ways.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reader, I shall add no more, but</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee to God and the Word of his Grace, which is not only able to translate thee out of Darkness into the Kingdom of his dear Son; but also build thee up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="tcp:51088:51"/>and give thee an Inheritance among them that are Sanctified. And now the God of Peace, that brought again from the Dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the everlasting Covenant, make thee perfect in every good Work to do his Will, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thee that, that is well pleasing in his Sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be be Glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  <p>OUR Great Apostle in this Epistle of his, having answered several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Conscience to the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> in this Chapter, refutes that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Error, that denied the Resurrection of the Dead.</p>
                  <p>He founds his Argument for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the Error, and the Establishing the contrary Truth, chiefly upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of a buried Jesus. Having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted this from <hi>v.</hi> 12. with the Intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of other Mediums; and also exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Inferences to <hi>v.</hi> 35. he there states the Adversary's Objection in these Words, <hi>With what Body do they come again?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Objection he answers (having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the Objector with the Title of a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51088:52"/>Fool, <hi>v.</hi> 36.) from the Nature of Grain thrown by the Sower into the Ground, rising into a Crop of beautiful Corn, pleasant to the Eye and useful for Food: Further, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and explaining the difference between human Bodies and the Flesh of Beasts, Birds and Fish, and the difference of their Glory from the Terrestrial and Coelestial Bodies, even the difference between Coeles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial. Bodies themselves in Glory.</p>
                  <p>Having managed this, from <hi>v.</hi> 36, to 42. he there applies it to the case in hand, shewing in <hi>v</hi> 42, 43, 44. That the Bodies of the Saints are <hi>sown in Corruption but raised in Incorruption. Sown in Dishonour, but raised in Glory,</hi> &amp;c. This he repeats, varying his Phrase, <hi>v.</hi> 53.54. And draws in this Inferencē in the Close of the 54th <hi>ver. Death is swallowed up in Victory;</hi> which Inference he confirms in a way of Triumph, in the Words of my Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Death where is thy Sting?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In which words you have the Apostle triumphing in the Person of every dying Believer, wherein are contained these Parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apostles Triumph, in <hi>v.</hi> 55.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Cause of it. 1st. Laid down ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively, <hi>v.</hi> 56. The Sting of the Believer's Death being pulled out by the abolishing of Sin, which is <hi>Death's Sting;</hi> and the Reign of the Law over him, which is the <hi>Strength of Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:51088:52"/>
                  <p> Positively laid down in ver. 57. <hi>viz.</hi> A Victory being obtained over Death, thro' our Lord Jesus Christ; which the Apostle mentions with Thanksgiving to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
                  <p>In handling these Words, I shall only insist on the Triumph or Ovation in ver. 55. and the rather, because the Prosecution of the Truth that shall arise from that Verse, will reach, and take in, the chief Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the following Verses.</p>
                  <p>In these words you have, as was afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the Believer's Triumph over Death, and that in a twofold Respect. 1. In respect of his Soul; <hi>O Death, where is thy Sting?</hi> 2. In respect of his Body; <hi>O Grave, where is thy Victory?</hi> Without spending further time in opening the Words; they afford us this Doctrinal Observation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That every true Believer, in the Moment of his Death, can Triumph over Death and the Grave, both in reference to his Soul and Body.</p>
                  <p>I shall divide this general Doctrine into two Branches, and speak to each part. The First is this,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a Believer, in the Moment of his Death, can Triumph over Death, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First (as the Lord shall enable me) I will prove this Truth, and then explain and illustrate it.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:51088:53"/>
                  <p> For Proof, I shall only give at present you two places of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Rev. xiv. 13. <hi>And I heard a Voice from Heaven, saying unto me, Write; Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth: yea saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their Labours; and their Works do follow them.</hi> Where first you have the Truth plainly asserted, — <hi>Blessed are the dead, that die in the Lord,</hi> or in dying in the Lord. 2dly, The Reasons of it. 1. They rest from their Labours. 2. Their Works follow them, <hi>i. e.</hi> They will meet with their Prayers and Duties entered on the File, for their review, as an addition to their eternal Delights. 3. You have here insinuated the Certainty and Importance of this Truth. 1. The Commandment to write, they are weighty things usually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Ink and Paper, and that for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration also.—<hi>Littera Scripta manet.</hi> 2. The Commander, the Spirit. I heard a <hi>Voice from Heaven, saying write,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The second place is, <hi>Heb.</hi> iv. 9. <hi>There remaineth therefore Rest to the People of God.</hi> Their rest is not in this World, but in another; and they enter upon it in the moment of Death; therefore they have then ground of triumphing.</p>
                  <p>I shall add to these the Experiences of Three Worthies. The first was <hi>David</hi>'s, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Altho' my House be not be so with God, yet he hath made with me an
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51088:53"/>everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and sure: For this is all my Salvation and all my Desire; altho' he make it not to grow. David</hi> was now on the brink of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, taking a view of the past and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Disorders of his House and Heart, yet rejoyces and triumphs in the view of the Covenant of Grace, and his Interest in it, and the influence it had on the Eternity he was entring into. The second was that of faithful <hi>Stephen,</hi> that glorious Proto Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr; who when the Stones that dashed out his Brains and Life, flew about his Ears, cryed out triumphantly, <hi>Lord Jesus, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive my Spirit.</hi> Acts vii. 59.</p>
                  <p>The last I shall mention, is the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the blessed Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. i. 23. <hi>For I am in a straight betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ, which is far better.</hi> But very pat and pertinent to the purpose, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He being harrassed with Labours, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils and Sufferings, at the apprehension of the time of his departure being at hand, triumphs thus, ver. 1. <hi>For we know that if our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a Building of God, an House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus, from the Holy Scriptures of Truth, proved the Doctrine, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Explication of it.</p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:51088:54"/>
                  <p>'Tis undeniable, That Contraries do the better illustrate one another, as black Spots make a whire Skin shine the brighter, and a Black-a-Moor is a Foil to set off an <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean:</hi> Therefore I shall illustrate this Truth, by another Contrary, that I might the more empharically explain it; which is this: The triumph of Death over an Unbeliever, and thus lay down the Doctrine to be explained.</p>
                  <p>Death in Death triumphs over the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, and the Believer triumphs over Death in dying.</p>
                  <p>I shall begin with the first Branch, <hi>viz.</hi> Death in Death triumphs over the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; and (as the Spirit of the Lord shall <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssist me) shew you in what respects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Death triumphs over the Unbeliever's sensual Pleasures. Where are now (says Death) your vain Pleasures that you wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly rolled yourself in, in your life time? What are become of those jolly, merry, frolicksome hours, that you lavish'd away with your frothy Companions? Where are now your drunken Cups and Glasses, and your riotous Feasts, with which you so often drowned and glutted your sensual Appetite? What do they profit you now? What plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure do you find now from your former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated acts of Lust and Beastliness? What relish now from those brutish tickling of swinish Delights? What does all your vain Merriment avail you now? What Fruit have you from those Things, that formerly you
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51088:54"/>reckoned your Heaven and Happiness? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Pleasures, you now shall have your belly-full of everlasting Torments. Now your merry Moments are turn'd into an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Sorrows. Now, instead of swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in Wine, and luxuriously feeding on Dainties, you shall Swim, World without End, in fiery Streams of burning Brimstone. You shall drink your Tears, and feed on your own tortur'd Flesh in endless and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ceasing Misery. Now, the flame of your Lust is succeeded by a hotter flame, even the Flame of Divine Vengeance. Now, instead of your frothy Spirit and vain Laughter, you shall have enough of howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weeping and gnashing of Teeth. Nay, you shall carry with you all your Lusts and Corruptions to Hell, not to please you, but to pain you. The same Water that the Fish swims in with delight, if heated over the Fire, will be the Fish's torment.</p>
                  <p>The Sins you acted with pleasure in the World, you shall act the same in great measure in Hell, but to your eternal tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: You shall there act your Revenges, but wound none with its poison'd Arrows, but your own Soul. You shall there have your covetous Desires enlarged, as wide as the Hell you are in; but it will only be your pain and punishment: Your own Lusts there, shall be the Flames that will scorch you. Come, thou trembling Wretch, will Death say, to the Place of sinning, and the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51088:55"/>Place of punishment; and thy very sinning shall be thy punishment. Oh! then will Death insult in the Words of the wise Man, <hi>Whatsoever thy Eyes desired, thou keepest not from them: Thou witheldost not thy Heart from any Joy,</hi> Eccles. ii. 10. And now all will be <hi>Vanity and Vexation of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to thee,</hi> part of <hi>ver.</hi> 11. And also in those Words as are written, <hi>Lu.</hi> xii. 19. <hi>Thou hast long said to thy Soul; Soul, take thine ease, eat, drink and be merry,—But, thou Fool, I am come this Night to require thy Soul of thee,</hi> part of ver. 20. And to add no more, Death will only, change the Moods and Tenses in that portion of Holy Writ, <hi>Eccl.</hi> ii. 9. insulting thus; <hi>Thou hast rejoyced, Oh! Young Man, in thy youth; and thy Heart has cheered thee in the days of thy youth; thou hast walked in the ways of thine Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes; but know thou now, thou trembling Wretch, that for these things, I am sent by the God of Justice, to bring thee into Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider this, thou voluptuous sensual Wretch, thou Drunkard, thou Belly-slave, thou unclean Beast, thou Blasphemer, thou Swearer, thou Reveller and Persecutor, consider this, and ponder it in thy Heart, thou must 'ere long come upon a Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed; this griefly King of Terrors will stare thee in the Face. The Sting, that now at a distance thou seest not, when he <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>mes near thee with open Mouth, thou wilt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51088:55"/>then see, and be dismally affrighted at that fatal Fork. Death and thee must meet e'er long, and thou knowest not, but this dismal meeting may be e'er a Week rouls about, and how wilt thou like such an horrid greeting, such a black welcome, such terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble language, and bitter insultings as you have heard. How do you relish and savour thus being triumph'd over in a dying Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Oh! consider this, and look out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Remedy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Death triumphs over the Pride of the Soul. The Pride of the Soul is either a Glorying before God, or a Glorying before Men. As it is a Glorying before God, I shall reserve that to speak of under its proper Head, which is to follow. The Soul before Man prides itself in its Endowments, either outward or inward. Death will then thus Glory over their Glory; Where are now your airy Honours, and bubble Dignities? What is become of your State and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur? Where are now your Crowns, O Kings, your Scepters, O Princes; I have tumbled them in the Dust, and my Spade has levelled them with the Earth. Could not your Purple, or your Furrs, your Swords and Maces, and Magistrates, defend you from my Arrest? What signified all your Guards, your Officers and Attendance, who could not protect you from me? What a bustle and fluster have you made? How have you set all in a flame about you, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51088:56"/>waded through blood and slaughter cruelty and oppression; and all manner of villany to attain such a Degree of Honour, and where is it now? My breath has blown it all away. Where is now, O spluttering Monarch, that great Conduct, that deep Policy, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with you conquered other Nations, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved your own? What could you use none of it to avoid my Attacks? Where is that Imperial Frown, that used to over-awe the gaping, cringing Crowd? I have divested it of all Majesty, and made it now meaner and simpler than the look of an <hi>Ideot;</hi> so says the Wise-man, <hi>A living Dog, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than a dead Lyon,</hi> Eccl. ix. 4. Thou cunning admired Politician in thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood; that madest all thy Neighbours tremble at thy fraudulent Wit; that stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died'st only how to over-reach, cheat, and impoverish; that thoughtest to hook in all to thy self! Why usest thou not some of thy cunningness to deceive me too? Why didst not thou play the Politician with me also? What do all thy Tricks and Artifices now advantage thee? Thou now perceivest that one <hi>event happeneth to the Wise, and to the Fool,</hi> Eccl. ii. 14, 15. <hi>As it happeneth to the Fool, so it happeneth to the Wise.</hi> Go now and try what all thy Wisdom and Cunning will do in Hell? Consider this you that are Great and Honourable on the Earth. You that are cunning to deceive in your Neighbourhood, that admire and flatter yourselves, that you can over-reach your Neighbours in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51088:56"/>There will come an hour of Death; that will efface and tarnish all the Glory of your Honours, Dignities, Wisdom and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies. There is no over-reaching Death. There is no such thing as being too cunning for the Grave. Death will soon tumble down all the Pageantry of your own Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Abilities, that you have set up in your own Conceit. The Fire of God's wrath will soon burn up your Cobweb Policy: <hi>For this your Wisdom is your Folly.</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks this should be as cold Water upon all burning Pride, and a check and rebuke to all your glorying, that very few of your Class and Complexion are chosen out to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. Your very Wisdom, Parts and Dignities for the most part, mark you out for eternal Misery. This is the Sum of what the Apostle Discourses, 1 Cor i. 26, 27.28, 29. <hi>For you see your calling, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, how that not many wise men after the flesh: not many mighty, not many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble are called,</hi> &amp;c. Read that Portion of the Holy Spirit of Truth, consider it seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and tremble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Death triumphs over the Riches and Possessions of a Man in such Heart-rendring words as these; O where are now, Man, all thy vast Possessions? What signifies thy Heaps of Gold and Silver? Hadst thou amassed together all the Treasures of the <hi>Indies;</hi> they could not bribe me, or buy me off. Eccl. iv. 8. <hi>Thine eye has no
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51088:57"/>been satisfied with riches in all thy life time.</hi> Now thou must carry none with thee to the Grave. <hi>Naked camest thou out of thy Mother's Womb, and naked shalt thou return thither, Job.</hi> i. 21. Instead of thy many Fields, Farms and Tenements, now thou must be content with so much Ground as thy Body can measure out. Now instead of thy many Bags of Gold and Silver, thou must rest satisfied, to be wrapt up in gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser Clay. Now farewel gilded Coaches, fair Palaces, splendid and well furnished Rooms, stately Beds, and all other costly. Furniture: Now for all the numerous Troop of cringing Attendants; thou shalt be surrounded with an Host of Vermine, and for the very same End, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Attendants, to feed upon thee too. What is become of all thy Glory and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency now? 'tis all laid in the Dust. <hi>Job.</hi> xx. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Though thy excellency did mount up to the Heavens, and thy Head reach unto the Clouds, Yet, thou shalt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish for ever, like thine own Dung: they which have seen thee, shall say; where is he? Thou shalt flye away as a Dream, and shalt not be found: Yea, thou shalt be chas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, as a Vision of the Night. The Eye also which saw thee shall see thee no more; neither shall thy place any more behold thee,</hi> and ver. 11. <hi>Thy Bones are full of the Sins of thy Youth; which shalt lye down with thee in the Dust.</hi> Thus will Death then <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p> Consider this, thou that forgettest God in the midst of thy plenty and abundance, that notwithstanding thy Pleasures and Treasures and great Possessions, thou must enter to Eternity, poor and wretched, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and naked, unless thou art cloathed with that Royal Robe of Christ's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. No riches then will suffice to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich thee, <hi>but the Gold tryed in the Fire, i. e.</hi> an interest in Jesus; who was made the perfect Captain of Salvation through suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. No Rayment will then so cover thee, as to hinder the Appearance of the shame of thy nakedness like that white Rayment, <hi>viz.</hi> the Righteousness of God, which is of Faith. And without that Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thou wilt stand speechless at the Bar of God, and then shall <hi>be bound hand and foot, and cast into utter darkness; where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth.</hi> Mat. xxii. 13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Death triumphs over a Man's own Righteousness. Men are apt through the horrid Pride of their Natures, to trust to their own doings for Salvation; and 'tis but too to common for Sinners in a State of Nature to apply Plaisters of their own making to the smarting Wounds of their Consciences, and to usurp Christ's Royal Prerogative of speaking Peace to their Souls; whereas, thus says the Lord, Isa. lvii. 19. <hi>I create the Fruit of the Lips Peace; I speak Peace to them, that are
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51088:58"/>afar off,</hi> viz. in a natural State, <hi>and to them that are nigh,</hi> viz. Them that are made, Eph. ii. 13. <hi>nigh to my Father by my Blood.</hi> But over all such white-wash'd painted Pharisees, will, insulting Death, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thus. Thou Pharisaical Fool, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedst Fire from God's Altar, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lord Jesus, Joh. v. 40. <hi>Thou wouldst not come to him, that thou mightest have Life;</hi> but thou hast <hi>kindled a Fire of thine own;</hi> nay like <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abiu</hi> hast brought <hi>strange Fire;</hi> Isa. l. 11. <hi>Thou hast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed thy self about with Sparks. Thou hast walked in the Light of thy Fire, and of the Sparks that thou hast Kindled. This thou shalt have now at God's Hand by</hi> my Dart <hi>to lye down in</hi> a Bed <hi>of Eternal Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows.</hi> Thou wer't for digging to thy self a way to Heaven; and hast refused the Heb. x. 20. <hi>New and living way, that the</hi> God and Father of Christ had <hi>consecrated;</hi> that is to say the <hi>Flesh of Jesus,</hi> or his <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, raised, glorified, human Nature;</hi> and though, Isa. lvii. 10. <hi>Thou wast weart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the greatness of thine own way;</hi> and hast often tryed in vain with thine own Doings and Works of the Law, and could'st not; but in spite of thy Teeth, the Fire of Hell that was in thy Conscience, would be often blazing out, yet <hi>said'st thou not, there is no hope;</hi> but would'st be still hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Life from the Dead; unprofitable Works of the Law; <hi>Thus thou didst find
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51088:58"/>the Life of thine Hands; therefore thou wast not then grieved;</hi> but still didst stifle all thy convictions: But now thou shalt grieve, and eternally grieve without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission; now thou wilt not be able to stifle thy convictions, but they will rend and tear thy Soul with unspeakable horrors for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>Now Psa. xvi. 4. <hi>Thy Sorrows shall be multiplied,</hi> that <hi>didst hasten after other Gods,</hi> and other Idol Righteousnesses. Thou leftest no stone unturned, no way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unessaied to procure warmth and life to thy Soul, Isa. lvii. 5. <hi>Thou didst enflame thy self with Idols under every Green Tree,</hi> and didst let thy Heart run out for Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Salvation upon every branch of, in it self beautiful Morality. Isa. lvii. 6. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the smooth Stones of the Stream was thy Portion, they were thy Lot, even to them thou hast procured a Drink-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> Thou hast set up thy Duties for Saviours, hast trusted in them, and so fallen down and Worshipped them. Isa. lvii. 7. <hi>Upon a lofty and a high Mountain hast thou set thy Bed: Even thither wentest thou up to offer Sacrifice. i. e.</hi> Thou didst confide in thy splendid towring profession, and didst make a God and Saviour thereof, by laying the whole stress of thy Soul upon thy outward Profession, without Faith in Jesus. Isa. lvii. 8. <hi>Behind the Doors also and the Posts hast thou set thy Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51088:59"/>everlasting Hills in the Highest Heavens. But now thy Mountains of Self-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, which thou <hi>wentest up to, to offer Sacrifice, to set thy Bed,</hi> and to <hi>build thy Nests upon;</hi> and, which thou <hi>thoughtest eternally strong,</hi> I thrash <hi>them to dust,</hi> and <hi>my breath blows them away like chaff.</hi> All thy Pharisaical Doings, do now leave thee; and nothing of them goes with thee to Hell, but the unpleasant remembrance thereof to torment thee, that thou wast such a Madman to set up these instead of Christ the only Saviour; as if thy good Duties, good Professions, good Frames, and good Privileges had undertook for thee from Eternity, had obeyed the Law for thee with a God-like Obedience, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the cursed death of the Cross for thee, were raised up again, and by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's right hand <hi>were exalted to be Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Saviours to give repentance and remission of sins,</hi> and were now ever living at the Fathers right hand to make interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for thee.

                  <p>Then consider it seriously, thou, that with the Pharisee in the Gospel, gloryest before the Lord, that thou art not as <hi>other
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51088:60"/>Men, an Extortioner, Unjust, an Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, or even as the Publicans and Sinners,</hi> and layest hold on this for eternal Life. Thy Conscience is not purged, but choaked and bribed with false Counters, of outward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. The unclean Spirit of Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may be, has been cast out, and thou thinkest that enough; but the Spirit of the Lord, the Gospel sanctifier has not been there at work; for he walked through dry places: The rest and Peace of Conscience thou hast obtained are not right; for 'tis written, <hi>he sought for rest and found none.</hi> The House, <hi>i. e.</hi> Thy Person has been swept by Reformation, and garnished with a fine Profession: But 'tis but the strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of wicked Spirits still.

                  <p>I should have improved this Branch in several uses; but having done somewhat of that under every Head, I shall only now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer a Question, which I suppose some, if not many, may be ready to ask under the Conviction of their miserable and lost E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state by Nature. May be some, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der present awakenings, are enquiring,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> What shall I do to be saved?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer in the Words of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Obj.</hi> What, nothing else but believe on Christ? That I do already, and did it ever since I was born, and so do all, that are not <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pagans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, First, They that say, they believed ever since they were born; never yet believed at all.</p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:51088:61"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rea.</hi> For Faith grows not in Nature's Garden, neither is it born with us, <hi>But it is the Gift of God,</hi> Eph. ii. 8. and 'tis writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Phil.</hi> i. 29. <hi>For unto you it is given on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him,</hi> &amp;c. Whence observe, that to believe on the Lord Jesus, must be given from above: Therefore 'tis not born with us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. They that think Believing an easy thing, I dare engage never yet believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> Nothing less then the Almighty Power of God in Christ, can work this Faith in us; even the same Power that created the World, must be put forth to an Act of Faith: 2 Cor. iv. 6. <hi>God who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, viz.</hi> in the Creation of the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> i. 3. <hi>hath shined in our Hearts, to give the light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi> Whence observe, That to believe is to have a view of the Glory of the Eternal Godhead, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Glory of the Father's Grace and Goodness, shining through Jesus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> 2. That this Divine Beam of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Light, is infused into the Soul by the same powerful Command, that sent down the creating Light, to inform the dark Chaos: <hi>God who commanded Light to shine out of Darkness,</hi> &amp;c. Nay, a greater Power must be put forth to an Act of Faith,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51088:61"/>than to the World's Creation; because in the World's Creation there was no Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though there was Indisposition; but in the sinful Soul where Faith is wrought, there is Indisposition and Opposition too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. They that do not plainly feel the Evil of indwelling Unbelief, never knew what Faith meant, <hi>John</hi> xvi. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. there when the Spirit is said to convince of Judgment and of Righteousness, he is said to convince of Unbelief too: And wherever Faith is, the contrary Principle of Unbelief rises always to oppose it, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii, 15, to the end; <hi>Gal.</hi> iv. 22, to the end, chiefly ver. 29. where though the Apostle speaks chiefly in both places of the contrary effects of the working Law and the working Gospel, in the same enlightned Conscience, yet the mutual opposition and warring of Faith and Unbelief, is also espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially included. I apprehend that to be a typical instance of this, spoke of to <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> Gen. xxv. 23. <hi>Two Nations are in thy Womb,</hi> &amp;c. This is evident, That no sooner a grain of saving Faith is sown in the Soul, but Unbelief, that afore lurked undiscover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in the Soul, rises instantly</hi> in Arms to war against it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 4. They that are under no influence of the indwelling Spirit, have no Faith; Rom. viii. 9. Now <hi>if any Man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his;</hi> and he that is not in Christ, has not a dram of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51088:62"/>Faith. They that have the Spirit, <hi>walk after the Spirit,</hi> v. 1. and are led by the Spirit, v. 14. they <hi>mind the things of the Spirit,</hi> v. 5. <hi>and their mortal Bodies are quickned, because of the Spirit of Christ that dwelleth in them,</hi> v. 11. Now they that are never spiritually, but carnally minded, that know nothing what the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwelling of the Spirit means, nor his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Influences and Operations; but are so far from knowing all these, that they reproach and blaspheme his blessed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Operations, as Whimsies, heat of Brain, Fanaticism, Enthusiasm, and the like; how can it be said, That such Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Spirit have the Spirit? And if they have not the Spirit, they are not only wholly ignorant of, but utter Enemies to the Grace of Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 5. Dare the Drunkard, the Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the Blasphemer, the Sabbath-breaker, the prophane, ignorant, carnal, vile Person say he has Faith? His prophanity, enmity and wickedness always give him the Lye to his teeth, and his sinful practise is an undoubted Test of the badness of his Faith, and that he professes a Lye, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses Faith in Jesus. <hi>Shew me,</hi> says the Apostle, <hi>Jam.</hi> ii. 18. <hi>thy Faith without thy Works,</hi> and <hi>I will shew thee my Faith by my Works. The Heart is purified by Faith,</hi> Acts xv. 9. Nay, <hi>Faith sanctifies through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,</hi> Acts xxvi. 18. Faith purifies the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51088:62"/>'Tis this <hi>Grace of God,</hi> this great Grace of Faith that <hi>teaches us, That denying Ungodliness and worldly Lust we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present World,</hi> Tit. ii. 11, 12. Nay, let me tell you, that such have no more Faith in Christ, than Turks or Heathens: They have no more of Christ and his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, than the chiming of Words in their Heads, and the sound of Phrases rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in their Memories: They have heard of one Jesus Christ, and that is all; but they know him not. As to any Soul, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and Conscience, Persuasion concerning him, his pardoning Grace and his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, they have as little as the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, that never heard of his Name: But they are worse than the Heathens, because they abuse his holy Name, to patronize their Lust and Wickedness.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But I can shew my Faith by my Works: I reform, hear, pray, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, weep, mourn for Sin, and profess: And have not I Faith then?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Thou mayst do all these, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable in themselves, yet not growing on the root of Faith; and as trusted in, they are an abomination to the Lord. There is a vast difference between the Fruits of Holiness flowing from Faith, and good Works set up instead of Christ, the Object of Faith. Thou mayst do all these, and much more, and yet make Saviours of them,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51088:63"/>and so be void of saving Faith, that looks to Jesus, and him alone at God's Right Hand for Salvation; and at last be damned for idolizing thy good Works, as well as others are for wallowing in their Lusts: For all equally refuse the Lord Jesus, and will have none of him for Life and Salvation, but tread with like scorn and contempt, the offered Son of God under foot? There's not a Dram of Gospel-Holiness, nor one Evangelical good Work, but what flows from Faith in the Person and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the once crucified, but now ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Jesus, at tho Father's Right Hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object</hi> 3. But for all my Reformation, Duties and Profession, I seek to Christ too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> That is perhaps, as the common Proverb runs, <hi>You will set the Cart before the Horse.</hi> Your Duties and Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall lead the Van, and Christ and his Righteousness shall bring up the Rear. You will put him to no other use, than to carry the Train of your ragged Robes of Righteousness, to patch up your Rags, and make up what is wanting in your Duties: But the Garment of Christ is seamless, and cannot be divided; but if it could be, that <hi>his new Cloth could be pieced to your old, the rent in yours would be the worse, Mat.</hi> ix. 16. Perhaps you are sensible of your inability to do, therefore ye look to him for assistance to help you to do for Life: But what says the Lord, <hi>The Just shall live by
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51088:63"/>Faith, Rom.</hi> i. 17. You would have him be King over you, to subdue your Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that for your subdued Iniquities you may get to Heaven. But you must look to him by Faith to be saved, and then morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Sin, and Holiness shall be given in unto you. The High Priest under the Law had his Mitre and Crown on his Head, and his Urim and Thummim on his Breast, to typifie, that the Lord Jesus executes his Kingly and Prophetical Office, by his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office; and all whom he instructs and subdues, he does it by shedding in the Faith and Hope, (either more or less) of their pardoned estate, through his Blood, into their Consciences. Again, do not you seek Christ because of your Reformation, Duties and Tears? If so, you bring your own Money in your Hands to buy Christ; and that's quite contrary to the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Lord makes of Heaven's Market, <hi>Isa.</hi> lv. 1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirsteth;</hi> that is, after the Things of the World, or their own Righteousness; for 'tis such thirsting, as ver. 2. calls <hi>spending Money for that which is not Bread, and labour for that which satisfieth not.</hi> These are summoned here to come to the Fair of the Almighty, where glorious Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are put to sale, Waters, Wine and Milk. But what price must the Buyers bring? No price at all. They that would speed in Heaven's Market, must <hi>come without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51088:64"/>and without price,</hi> Heb. xii. 13. Esau <hi>sought to buy Repentance with Tears, but he found no place for it.</hi> All buying in the meaning of Christ, is but accepting, and he gives the power to do that too: Therefore come to Christ as poor, blind, miserable, naked, vile, ungodly Wretches, and he will be Riches to the Poor, Eyes to the Blind, Happiness to the Miserable, Cloathing to the Naked, and Sanctification to the Vile and Ungodly. The voice of the Gospel is for the present time, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 2. <hi>Now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of Salvation.</hi> Heb. iii. 18. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your Hearts.</hi> The Gospel does not say, Go home now, and pray, and mourn, and weep, and come to morrow, or next week, or next month, after you have prepared and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your self with so much praying, mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, weeping, repenting and reformation, then come to Christ; bur come now; now is the accepted time, now is the day and hour of Salvation. But, further, some may be ready to ask me,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> What is believing in Christ, or Faith in him?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It would be too tedious now to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the Question as it ought to be; I shall only briefly thus define it, and then make good my Definition. Faith, as strictly and properly taken, is a powerful Conscience-Perswasion wrought by God, concerning
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51088:64"/>Christ and his Things, their excellency and suitableness to the Soul, and more or less concerning the Soul's Interest in them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God. Faith in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to perswade, and really signifies a perswading. 'Tis phrased in Old Testament-language, in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Prophecy, cencerning his Children, <hi>Gen.</hi> ix. 27. <hi>God shall perswade Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem.</hi> And to the same purport 'tis phrased in the New Testament: 'tis said to be, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 6. <hi>A light shining into a dark Heart;</hi> which is a perswasive Knowledge, called, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 17. the <hi>Righteousness of God in the Gospel, revealed from Faith to Faith.</hi> 'Tis named, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 21. a <hi>manifestation without the Law of the Righteousness of God,</hi> ver. 25. stiled <hi>a declaration of his Righteousness for the remission of Sins;</hi> and defined to be, <hi>Heb.</hi> xi. 1. <hi>The Evidence of things not seen,</hi> which are Christ and his Righteousness, which are wholly without us, not seen by our bodily Eyes, or natural Reason or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. The Spirit in working Faith is said to take of Christ and his Things, and shew them to the Soul, <hi>John</hi> xvi. 14, 15. God the Father, as the Worker of it, so is said to real his Son in the Soul, <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 16. Which Expressions evidently import a perswasive Knowledge. 2dly, This Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is an inward Conscience-Perswasion, and not only an Head Knowledge, or noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51088:65"/>Perswasion, <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 15. but <hi>when it pleased God,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 16. <hi>to reveal his Son in me,</hi> &amp;c. 1 John v. 10. <hi>He that believeth, hath the witness in himself; i. e.</hi> a Conscience-Testimony. 3dly, This Conscience Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion is very powerful, for it instantly works a great change on the whole Man, Heart, Lip and Life: 'Tis a creating Power, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> iv. 6. an exceeding great power, <hi>Eph.</hi> i. 19. and 'tis the Declaration of the King of Heaven to the Conscience; and <hi>where the Word of the King is, there is Power,</hi> Eccles. viii. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And (as Divines say) in this the Soul is wholly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, like a dark Room, that has light let into it from without. The object of this Faith is Christ, and the Things of Christ, as in that forementioned Place, <hi>John</hi> xvi. 14. <hi>He shall glorify me, for he shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you,</hi> ver. 15. <hi>All things that the Father hath are mine; therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shew it unto you.</hi> The Rule of Faith is the written the Word of God, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 19, 20, 21. And this I take to be Faith strictly and properly taken. But there are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Instantaneous Effects and Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this inward revelation of Jesus, which are also called believing, which is the Souls accepting of this manifested Jesus, and his Righteousness, venturing itself upon him, and committing it self to him; which Acts are set forth in Scripture by various
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51088:65"/>phrases; as, Looking unto him, <hi>Isa.</hi> xlv. 22. Coming unto him, <hi>John</hi> vi. 37. Casting our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and burden upon him, <hi>Psal.</hi> lv. 22. Staying upon him, <hi>Isa.</hi> lviii 10. Leaning upon him. <hi>Cant.</hi> viii. 5. Trusting in him, and many more. And thus, I have answered this Question with all the brevity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuity I could, as the Lord has enabled me, and as time would give me leave. And now, methinks, some are ready to ask in the words of the blind Man, whom Christ had restored to his Sight.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But <hi>who is he that I might believe on him, John</hi> ix. 36. You say he must be seen and ventured on; pray then who is he?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall answer you from the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of the Apostles, preached by them after they were endued with Power from on high. And first the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> tells you who he is, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. 22, 23. <hi>Jesus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, a Man approved of God; him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered by the determinate Counsel and Fore-knowledge of God ye have taken, and by wicked Hands have crucified and slain,</hi> comp. with 32. <hi>This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we are all Witnesses.</hi> 33. <hi>Therefore being by the right Hand of God exalted, hath received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Once more, <hi>Acts</hi> v. 30. <hi>The God of our Fathers hath raised up Jesus, whom he slew and hanged upon a Tree,</hi> 31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right Hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51088:66"/>remission of Sins.</hi> Add to these, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 2. <hi>Looking unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith, who for the joy set before him</hi> [in the saving of Sinners] <hi>endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cross, despising the shame, and is now set down at the right Hand of God.</hi> In short, he that <hi>was made of the Seed of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid according to the Flesh</hi> (Rom. i. 3.) who <hi>yet is God over all blessed for ever,</hi> Rom. ix. 5. That mighty glorious God-Man, who was born of a Virgin, that lived and preached in <hi>Judea,</hi> Rom. viii. 34. that <hi>died, yea rather that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also ever lives to make intercession</hi> (Col. i. 18.) <hi>the first born from the dead</hi> (Col. i. 15.) <hi>and the first born of every Creature,</hi> the despised <hi>Jesus of Nazareth</hi> (Col. ii. 9.) <hi>in whom the fulness of the Godhead dwells bodily:</hi> And all the Glory, Excellency, Beauty and Majesty that shines on Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is the Glory, Excellency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. This is he, that blessed Object of your Faith, this is he whom you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in. When he lived on Earth, the Faith of his Children was more dark about his God-head than his human Nature, but now he is in Heaven, their Faith is more at a loss about his human Nature, and it is to be lamented that the glorified hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, even Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is so little in the Preaching, Profession, Faith and Experience of God's own Children. But yet this is the Lord, whom we, thro'
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51088:66"/>Grace, have seen and tasted to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: Will not you too, O Sinners! come and taste and see how gracious he is? <hi>Cant.</hi> v. 16. <hi>This is our Friend, this is our Beloved, O Daughters of Jerusalem.</hi> He is altogether lovely, <hi>Cant.</hi> v. 10. <hi>He is the chief among ten thousand. He</hi> is able <hi>Heb.</hi> vii. 25. <hi>to save you to the uttermost.</hi> O come therefore and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture your Souls upon him, commit them to him: O that you would but try him! you have tried his Patience to the utmost, by your Rebellion and Obstinacy in Wickedness. O that you would but try his boundless Grace, by casting your selves into the Ocean of it! You must venture on his Grace, or you must be damned, <hi>Mark</hi> xvi. 16. <hi>He that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth shall be saved, he that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> If you accept not of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Jesus, you despise <hi>this only Sacrifice, and there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sin but a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which shall devour the Adversary,</hi> Heb. x. 26.</p>
                  <p>I am now come to the second Branch, the Believers triumphing over Death.</p>
                  <p>And 1. The Believer triumphs over the Sting of Death, and what else does concur to make it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Believer triumphs over every thing else in Death that is formidable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> The Believer triumphs over the Sting of Death. He then can rejoicingly cry out, O Death, I fear thee not! thou art very harmless unto me. Thou comest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51088:67"/>like a Dragon, with open Mouth; but where is thy Sting? I dread not that open Mouth, or that wide Throat. I with Joy am swallowed up of it, and pass thro' it up to the highest Heavens into my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's Arms. Here at this dark Portal, I undress my self of this mortal Flesh, and fly with holy Confidence to the Presence of the Lamb upon the Throne, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God the Father in him, and the bright innumerable Company above in this full Assurance, that I shall not be found naked. Welcome Death, to dissolve and pull down this earthly House of my Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, that so I may go <hi>to my House, not made with Hands, the Building of God, eternal in the Heavens,</hi> 2 Cor. v. 1. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sweet Messenger, that comest to fetch me home from this mad, confused, wicked, raging, tottering World, into my Father's House. I thank thee, O grim Porter! who openest the Gates to eternal Happiness. 'Tis true, the news of thy Approach did terrify me, as the Report of the Coming of rough blustering <hi>Esau,</hi> with his armed Men, did <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. xxxii. 6, 7. But yet now thou art come to me, I can say as he did, I behold thy black and grisly Face, <hi>Gen.</hi> xxxiii. 10. as the Face of the Angel of God, or the Messenger of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. For in thy black Face I see Beauty, in thy grisly Terrors great Glory. In thy Dragon's Mouth no Sting at all. <hi>O Death! where is thy Sting?</hi> Thus the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51088:67"/>Believer in dying triumphs over the Sting of Death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Believer in dying triumphs over those things that go to make up the Sting of Death. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Over Sin. <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin,</hi> says the Words of my Text. And 1. In its Guilt. 2. In its Pollution. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Over the Guilt of Sin. Thus the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in dying glories over it: O Guilt of Sin! who in my Life-time, since my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, notwithstanding I was washed with the Blood of Jesus, and he had obtained an eternal Redemption for me, didst often use to sting my Conscience, and thereby to fill me with Dread and Horror, and so didst weaken my Faith and Confidence in the Lord Jesus; didst strengthen the Hands of my Unbelief, in making me depart from the living God: Didst make me often come in Prayer to God as my angry Judge, and not as to my Father, reconciled to me in Christ. And thereby didst bind up my Soul, fetter my Spirits, so that I had no freedom of Access to God thro' Christ: Thou didst often deal with me as the Man that went from <hi>Jerusalem</hi> to <hi>Jericho;</hi> didst wound me and strip me, and leave me half dead: Didst often force me to entertain hard, murmuring and outrageous Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my dear Lord and Master Jesus, and my reconciled God and Father in him: Didst often make me add Iniquity to my
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:51088:68"/>Sin, and a carnal, loose, vain Conversation to my inward Deadness and Enmity; and when Death approached to bring me to a State of Perfection in Glory, didst repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him to me as a dreadful King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. But now Death is come, and has exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted his Office, I welcome him, and laugh thee to Scorn. Free Grace has disarm'd him of the Sting that thou wouldst have given him against me. I shall now no more be perplexed with thy Gripes: I shall now plainly see my Redemption eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and always the same, without as much as a Cloud as big as a Man's Hand to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose. I shall never look off the Lord, my Righteousness, my Sanctification and Covering, but always behold my Father's reconciled Face in the Face of my beloved Jesus: I shall never depart from him any more: I shall now have perpetual Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Enlargement of Soul before him: I shall never have an hard Thought of him any more, nor ever sin the least sin against him any more. Farewel eternally, O Guilt of Sin! thou canst not enter into Heaven, where I am going. Thus I spurn thee now, mounting up into everlasting Glory.</p>
                  <p>Death triumphs over the Pollution of sin, and makes a full End of Corruption and Iniquity. Then may the Believer cry, O filthy fink of Sin! thou shalt defile me no more. How often, even since Conversion, hast thou ravished my Virgin Soul? How
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:51088:68"/>oftentimes a day hast thou scattered thy Filth in my Conscience, and left an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd Taint there? How often, when I was going to approach an Holy God, didst thou appear in my Soul in thy ugly Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, to terrify me, and to turn me aside from the living God? Yea, and though I often saw the Righteousness of Christ co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering me, yet thou often filledst my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science with such a cloud of Filth and Stench, that that glorious Covering was hid from mine Eyes; but now thou shalt blind mine Eyes no more: I shall now have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect uninterrupted Visions of that spotless beauteous Garment wrapping me round, and that to all Eternity. Not the least speck of thee shall enter into Heaven; in my Father's House, I am entring into, there's nothing but compleat Purity and Holiness: There is not the least Atom of Dirt in the Streets of the <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above. Here, thou filthy Load, I finally part with thee, I shall never be defiled any more with thee. Hallelujah, <hi>Amen.</hi> And thus the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever triumphs over Sin; that is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Sting of Death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Believer triumphs over the Law, which the Words of my Text call the strength of Sin; and the Law, or the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works, is the strength of Sin (though it be in itself holy, just and good) in a twofold respect. 1. It condemns the Soul, and tortures the Conscience; so drives
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51088:69"/>the Soul farther from God, and encreases the Enmity against him, and thereby puts the Soul more under the Power of Sin, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging and strengthening Sin's Dominion over it, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 16. <hi>Sin shall not have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over you, for you are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Where 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently implied, that to be under the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Law, is to be under Sin's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; and this is exemplified and proved plainly and clearly in the former Part of the seventh of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which I cannot now stay to open. 2. The Law judicially delivers the Soul up to the Will and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sin by way of Punishment. <hi>Thus the Son of God is said to come in the Likeness of sinful Flesh, and for sin, or sinning, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn sin in the Flesh,</hi> Rom. viii. 3. Sin, by the condemning Law, has assign'd it pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, as Executioner, a Power of sinning in the Soul; from which Sentence, only a crucified Jesus can free the Soul. The Law therefore as it is the strength of Sin, is a sore Exercise to the Believer, and the strength of the old Man, or the Body of Death in his Soul, all his life time; but in his Death he may thus glory over it. Thou Covenant of Works, thou killing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in my Conscience, though I was much freed from thee by the Law of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is of Faith, yet thou didst still work there <hi>Gendring unto Bondage,</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51088:69"/>Christ Jesus,</hi> Gal. iv. 29. <hi>Thou that wast born after the Flesh, didst persecute that that was born after the Spirit,</hi> Gal. iv. 30. <hi>But now the Bond-woman and her Son shall be quite cast out.</hi> Thou didst all my Life-time endeavour all ways to keep up Guilt in my Conscience, and if at any time removed, to do it away by Obedience to thee, by legal Sorrow and Contrition, by Resolutions to amend, and greater Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness for the future. Whilst I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diverted from making first Applications to the Blood of sprinkling, so that my fin was rather oftentimes compounded for, than in Faith wash'd away, in that Fountain that is opened for Sin and for uncleanness. Zech. xiii. 1. Whence I was not only diverted from continual Believing into a bleeding Jesus, but had my Conscience rather stupified than healed, my sin made little, harmless and familiar, and rather encouraged, than a real dying unto it, and hence oftentimes my Soul cast into a deep Lethargy. But now I am absolutely freed from that Yoke of Bondage <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> in my Conscience, and I shall be made for ever, to <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 1. <hi>Stand fast in that Liberty, wherewith the Son hath made me free indeed,</hi> John viii. 36. Thus will the Believer in Death, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the Law as it is the Strength of Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Believer in Death may glory over the Justice of God, as it is arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Vengeance against Sinners. The
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51088:70"/>Believers are fully delivered in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time from the stroke of Divine Justice, yet they do oft-times not so fully apprehend it: But after Death, the Believer shall see as he is seen, apprehend as he is apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then be enabled to rejoice thus. Divine Justice, whilst I lived, though thou wast my Friend in Jesus, yet many times I dreaded thee as mine enemy; but now I plainly see that thou art my Friend indeed, and that it is <hi>just with thee to justifie me</hi> in <hi>the Lord, my Righteousness,</hi> Rom. iii. 26. compared with Isa. xlv. 24, 25. Thy Sword that was pointed at my Breast, and should have now thrust me down to Hell, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by my crucified Lord into his own Bowels, and I am now made for ever to escape, <hi>Being made more than a Conqueror through him that loved me,</hi> Rom. viii. 37. My dying Saviour in Falling, wrested thy Weapon out of thy Hand, and made his blessed Body a Grove, planted from thy poisonous Quiver, so that there is not an Arrow now left to spend upon me. I now come, O Justice, in the Right of my Lord, to sit for ever down in his heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; to sing Hallelujahs to that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and true God for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Believer in Death may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over Satan. Satan, though a Soul is Translated out of his Kingdom, yet thro' his restless Enmity, is always seeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>our. He has Wiles, Methods, and cunning
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:51088:70"/>Devices of Temptations to ensnare; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious Suggestions, fierce Assaults, and fiery Darts to terrifie; with these several ways of Attacks is the poor Believer har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassed as long as he lives; but in Death he can insult over all. Thus then can the Believer vaunt it: Satan, thou hast long tortured me with throwing in wicked and blasphemous Suggestions, and then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suadedst me, to my great Terrour, I had sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost. Thou shalt no longer be able to throw in any more of thy fiery Insinuations. I am now beyond the reach of any of thy Darts. Thou hast always endeavoured to tempt me to Sin, and then to make me question my Interest. But now I shall sin no more, nor question my Interest any longer. I shall not now be tempted any more to Despair on the one hand, nor presume on the other. Thou darest not appear where I am going. Thou vile Satan, I shall be disturbed with thee no longer. I shall have no further Concerns with thee, till I come with my Lord to sit in Judgment upon thee at the great Day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly, and lastly,</hi> The Believer can thus triumph over the World, which is the last thing that goes to make up the Sting of Death. Thou empty confused World, that didst use to terrify me with thy Threats, I defy thee and them now; thou wast wont to allure me with thy Flatteries: I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their undermining now. I scorn thy
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:51088:71"/>Rattles, and thy painted Beads, and thy airy Bubbles. I dread not now thy hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Face; nor shall I any more be moved with thine Enchantments. It will add to my Pleasure in my Mansions of Glory, to see thee burnt for thy Witchcraft; I shall no more dread thy mighty Hunters, nor be aw'd with thy grim Tyrants, nor be enslaved in Body, or Conscience, by thy bloody Laws, nor be harrased with brutish Execution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: There are no oppressing Magistrates, no Catch-poles, nor Informers in the place I now enter to. Nay, now I tread under foot all in thee, that is enticing; I set Health, Wealth, Pleasures, Honours, Friends, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and all in one Scale, and my dear Fore-runner in the other, and that Scale weighs down now to the Ground; I now go to the heavenly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and that better Country, where I shall have better Riches, and more durable Substance, better Honours, better Pleasures, and far better Relations. Thus will the Believer then triumph over Death, and whatsoever goes to make up the Sting of it.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Believer can triumph over every thing else in Death, that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. To instance in one for many, Nature abhors a Dissolution, and the Soul, though it has but a bad Lodging, does not care to be turned out of Doors. Its tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Glay it cares not to be dislodged of, though its all over tattered, and needs
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51088:71"/>Repairs. It shrinks back at entring into a new way of acting separate from the Body, when it has all the while been accustomed to act only by such an Organ. It has been used to such a poor Garment, yet as sorry as it is, it knows not how to be undressed of it, and made naked. Whereas now in the Moment of Death, that's over to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever: It can cry then like his Master giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Ghost, <hi>All is finished.</hi> It sees a better House to go to, upon its being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed of this, even the Father's House, that has many Mansions. And a better Garment to be cloated with, even his elder Brother's glorious Robe of curious Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery: And can triumph in the Words of the Apostle, varying a little the Form of speaking, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I now see <hi>that my earthly House of this Tabernacle being dissolved, I have a Building of God, an House not made with Hands, eternal in the Heavens. In this I have groaned, earnestly desiring to be cloathed upon with my House which is from Heaven.</hi> I am sure, <hi>being so cloathed, I shall not be found naked.</hi> I <hi>that in this Tabernacle did groan, being burdened,</hi> not for <hi>that I would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed, but cloathed upon;</hi> And <hi>now Mortality shall be swallowed up of Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Believer triumphs over this Terror of Death, and every thing else in Death that is terrible. And thus I have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51088:72"/>finished the first Branch of my Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Believer, in Death, triumphs over Death, in reference to his Soul. I should pass away now to various Uses, but time will not permit; I shall therefore wind up this Branch with one Word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to poor Sinners.</p>
                  <p>O you poor perishing Sinners, over whom my Bowels yearn! In my Master's Name I beg, that you would suffer a Word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. You must needs be all perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firmly of this, that you must once die, and you know not how soon: You may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps go to bed well, and never see Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Would you then in that Instant of Time avoid being insulted over by Death, and triumph over that cruel Dragon, Death and fatal Sting; then look up to that brazen Serpent, the blessed Jesus, erected on the Pole of God's Word, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hope, set before you in the Gospel. O fly to it for Refuge! Would you glory over that King of Terrors, and all his Dread, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1. <hi>Be strong in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus.</hi> Would you die the Death of the Righteous; then you must live the Life of the Righteous; and we are told what that is, <hi>Rom.</hi> i. 17. <hi>The Just shall live by Faith.</hi> Believe in the Lord Jesus, the exalted Prince and Saviour, and his God like Righteousness; and earnestly beg of the Lord for the <hi>Revelation of the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:51088:72"/>Righteousness of God to you from Faith to Faith,</hi> Rom. i. 17. That so when that Faith is going to be swallowed up of Vision, you may triumph over Death, and all its Terrors, in respect of your precious and immortal Soul.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>SOME of you may remember, that from the Words opened and explained, I raised this general Observation. That every true Believer, in the Moment of his Death, can triumph over Death and the Grave, as well in reference to his Soul as to his Body.</p>
                  <p>I divided it into two Branches; the first whereof was this: That a Believer in the Moment of his Death, can triumph over Death in respect of his Soul, which I have dispatched and now proceed to handle the Second, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That a Believer in Death can triumph over the Grave, in respect of his Body.</p>
                  <p>I judge it most convenient to use the same Method in the Prosecution of this Branch, as I did in the former, <hi>viz.</hi> to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate it by its contrary; and therefore lay it down thus to be spoken to.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:51088:73"/>
                  <p> The Grave can triumph over the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer's Body; but the Believer can tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over the Grave, in respect of his Body.</p>
                  <p>Sinners are apt to make Gods of their Bodies, honouring them excessively with Food, Rayment, Lodging, and the like; and to glory in the Health, Beauty and Strength of their Bodies; but the Grave will trample upon all these. Instead of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Wine, and choice Dainties, the Grave will fill their Mouths and Bellies with Dust: Their Silks, and Laces, and abominable impudent whorish Head-dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, their proud and lofty Crests shall be exchanged for stinking Rottenness, odious Filth, and crawling Maggots. And instead of their stately Houses and Down-Beds, they must be content to take up with a dark Hole, and a cold Bed of Clay. The most vigorous Health then is vanished; a little pitiful Vermine can there deal with the stoutest <hi>Hector,</hi> and the strongest <hi>Sampson.</hi> The fairest Face will soon prove as dismal there as the foulest Monster. The most exquisite Beauty look as squallid, and as horrid as the ugliest Blackamoor; and none shall be able to see any Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the rotten Skull of the one and the other. But having spoken somewhat to these things already, and being desirous to hasten to other Matter, I shall here put a Conclusion to this, and only add three or
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51088:74"/>four Things to be considered in. Death, wherein Death and the Grave triumphs over a Sinners Body, but the Believer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs over Death and the Grave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall speak to both the Contraries together by way of <hi>Antithesis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Natural Death to the Wicked is an entrance to eternal Death, <hi>Heb.</hi> ix. 27. <hi>And 'tis appointed to Men once to die, but after this, the Judgment.</hi> The Righteous Law of God has so ordered it for Sinners, that Death, as a Sergeant shall arrest and cast their Bodies to the Grave, as to a Dungeon, there to be reserved in Death's Chains to the Judgment of the Great Day. But natural Death to the Godly is a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to eternal Glory: And Death, like a skilful Chymist, takes their Bodies, and puts them into the Alembick of the Grave, and there distils them into pure Spiritual and Glorious Bodies against the Great Day; but more of this hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Natural Death to the Wicked, is a part of the penal Sentence of the Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> ii, 17. — <hi>For in the Day that thou catest thereof, thou shalt surely die.</hi> The Law threatned a threefold Death, spiritual, temporal and eternal. The <hi>Hebraism</hi> in the Original is emphatical to the Purpose, <hi>dying thou shalt die.</hi> To me having this Force, dying in thy Body, thou shalt die eternally in thy Soul. 'Tis evident, that to the Ungodly, natural Death is a part of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:51088:74"/>that punishment inflicted by the righteous Law of God? and what Death is, the Grave is the same. If one be the Law's Jaylor to the Body, the other is the Law's Prison. But to the Godly 'tis far otherwise: For as Death has lost his Sting to them, so has the Grave: 'Tis not to them penal, but purely natural; the putting off the old <hi>Adam,</hi> that the second <hi>Adam</hi> may take possession of the whole Body. The Apostle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. discoursing of the Necessity of the natural Death of Believers, argues thus, That the old <hi>Adam</hi> had first took possession of the Elect Vessels Bodies, ver. 46. That what of the old <hi>Adam</hi> is there, is earthly, and tends to Earth and Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Ver. 47. It being the proper Nature thereof. Ver. 48. Concludes thus, That the Image of the old <hi>Adam</hi> on the Body, must be wholly laid aside, and that by Death; so that the Image of the second might take sole and full Possession. Ver. 49. <hi>As we have born the Image of the Earthy, we shall also bear the Image of the Heavenly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 Natural Death is a separation of the Body from all Life; and thus it is to the Wicked: Their Dust dwell alone in the Grave, united to nothing, only there reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an Almighty Power of God, in an extraordinary way, for the Glory of his Justice hereafter. But the Dust of the Godly in their Graves, are united to the Body of Christ now in Heaven, and there
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:51088:75"/>is held still a secret Correspondence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their scattered Dust and the Life of Jesus, who in this sense, is the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Life.</hi> John xi. 25. To make this more evident, 'tis to be considered, 1. That the Person of the Believer, both Body and Soul, in the first act of Faith, is united to the Person of Christ; yea, joyned to the Body of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> vii. 4.2. That by vertue of this Union, the second <hi>Adam</hi> takes Possession of the Body as well as the Soul, as proved before from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 45, to 50, especially 46. <hi>Howbeit, that was not first which is spiritual; but that which is natural, and afterward spiritual.</hi> Observe that the Apostles Discourse must be here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Bodies of the Saints, for it is the Resurrection of their Bodies he is a proving. 3. The Believer holds his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life upon another tenure than he did formerly, even from the second <hi>Adam,</hi> by vertue of his Implantation into him. The great Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring how his Body had been supported in the Work of Christ, under all Perils, Pains, Watchings, Labours, Imprisonments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> almost insupportable, declares the Cause, ver. 10. That it was from the Life of Jesus made manifest in his Body, repeating the same in the last Clause of the 11th Verse, only instead of Body, there he writes <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Flesh:</hi> All which thus explained, does evidently prove, that the Bodies of the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:51088:75"/>Saints derive now their natural Life in great measure from another Root. 4. As an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Consequence of this, that that Life the Body holds from Christ, does not quite vanish, as that of the first <hi>Adam</hi> does; but is gathered up into Christ, and retreats back to him the Root, as the Sap of Trees in Winter Time falls down from the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Root. And I take that to be the Meaning of that Place of holy Writ; or at least I may allude to it, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 3. <hi>Your Life is hid with Christ in God,</hi> especially because of the following Verse, <hi>when Christ who is our Life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in Glory;</hi> which Glory respects the Body as well as the Soul. 'Tis to me plain that there is a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Commerce between the Living glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body of an exalted Jesus, and the Dust of a deceased Believer, which may be further proved from <hi>Mat.</hi> xxii. 31, 32. The Argument Christ himself uses to prove the Resurrection of the Dead, and the force of his Argument I apprehend to lye here: That God calls himself the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> though dead: That God is not the God of the Dead, but of the Living, therefore, that though <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac, &amp;c.</hi> were dead, yet they were still united to the living God, and by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of those secret Beams of Life from him (the inseparable Effects of that Union) that still corresponded with, and preserved their
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51088:76"/>mouldered Bodies in the Grave, they should be raised up at the last Day. This sense of the Place seems to be confirmed from the Answer of our Lord Jesus to <hi>Martha</hi>'s Objection against the present Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of her Brother, <hi>John</hi> xi. 24. Martha <hi>saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the Resurrection at the Last Day.</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>Jesus saith unto her, I am the Resurrection and the Life,</hi> &amp;c. As if he should have said, thou grantest that I can raise him up at the last Day; but how? Is it not by Vertue of that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is between his dead Body, and my living Body? If then, I will be his Life, and therefore his Resurrection. I am now his Life, and consequently can be now his Resurrection. I shall add that Argument, the Lord, the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Life abides and dwells in a Believer for ever, in his Body as well as his Soul. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 19. <hi>What, know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in you,</hi> &amp;c. If it be granted then, that he does still in-dwell in the separate Soul of the Believer, why not, in a sense, in the separate Body too? He brooded for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly over the Chaos, till it was formed into a beautiful Creation; and why not in like manner over the Dust, till the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time of actual Life by the Father comes? But,</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:51088:76"/> 4. Natural Death tends to an utter Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition. Natural Death in it self, tends to an utter Consumption of the Body, and that by Steps retrogade to the Methods of the first Creation. <hi>First,</hi> There was a Chaos created, and then that disposed and digested into a very beautiful and lovely Frame; but Death deals thus with Man, the Epitome of the Creation, reduces the fair Structure to a Chaos, or Heap of Dust, and then commits it to the Grave to anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate it. And so would the Bodies of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners be annihilated, especially in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Conflagration; but that, as has been afore mentioned, the God of Nature by his infinite Power preserves and fits them to be Vessels of Wrath for Destruction, and at last raises them, that they might be for ever miserable Companions to their miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Souls, on which he might make the Power of his Vengeance known to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. That as the Body has been a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to the Soul in sinning, so it shall be World without end, in suffering. But as to the Bodies of the Saints, it is otherwise. Death only sows their Bodies into the Ground, that they might be quickned again into more glorious Bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 36, 37. compare with 42, 43 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And pulls down the old tottering House, that it may be built up a more glorious Fabrick in the Day of Resurrection, and they shall arise then from the refining Alembick of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51088:77"/>the Grave, with several wonderful Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages; especially these five,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Then Corruptibility shall put on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptibility, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 53. For this <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible must put on Incorruption,</hi> and when thrown into the Grave corruptible Bodies then shall be raised incorruptible— Ver. 42. <hi>Sown in Corruption, raised in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption.</hi> The Bodies of the Saints shall have no tendency to decay any more; no more shall the Bodies of the Wicked: but here will be the Difference; the Bodies of the Saints will be unpassible, and will not be capable of suffering Pains; but the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Wicked, though not apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, yet will be the Seat of eternal Pains and Torments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Then Immortal shall put on Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 53, 54. And the Bodies of the Saints sown mortal, shall rise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal. There will be no dying in the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> above, nor decaying, nor fading; but Bodies as well as the Spirits of the Just being made perfect, shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the same in that glorious State to all Eternity. 'Tis true, the Bodies of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers shall never die more; but their Living and Continuing will be a constant Dying. They will be dying to all Eternity, but never absolutely die; and happy would it be for them, if they could altogether cease to be. But on the Bodies of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, the second Death can have no
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:51088:77"/>Power at all. As for instance, <hi>The last Enemy that Christ will destroy for them, will be Death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 26. <hi>And then Death will be swallowed up in Victory,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 54.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then natural Flesh will put on Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xv. 44. <hi>It is sown a natural Body, it is raised a spiritual Body, There is a natural Body, and there is a spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Not that these natural Bodies in the Saints shall be turned into the very Essence of Spirits; but they shall come as near their Natures as 'tis possible, for corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to come. So says our Lord himself, in answer to the <hi>Sadducees</hi> Cavil, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxii. 30. <hi>For in the Resurrection, they neither marry, nor are given in Marriage; but are as the Angels of God in Heaven.</hi> i. e. They shall be as near to the Nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as is possible. They will be of a purer and more incompound Substance, than the purest Elements of Fire: They will be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued then with wonderful agility and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and their motion surpassing swift; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they will fly then as swift as Thought. We experience that our Thoughts now speed in an Instant to the farthermost Regions of the Earth, whilst the heavy Log of a Body stays behind, and can go no faster than its Legs can carry it, or some more artificial means. But doubtless then our Bodies, that believe will be fitted to keep pace with our glorified Souls, in all their Motions, for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:51088:78"/>the Glory of Christ, not hindred by Sicknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Ails, nor made slow with any weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, imperfection, or mutilation. The Sun is swift in his race; but what is his race compared to that of the glorified Bodies of the Saints then!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Dishonour then will put on Honour, and <hi>that that is sown in Dishonour will be raised in Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 43. Then they will be in part clothed with the Glory that is upon the Body of an exalted Jesus. 'Tis true, there will be difference in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, though not in kind: <hi>For as there is one Glory of the Sun, another Glory of the Moon; and another Glory of the Stars: For one Star differeth from another Star in Glory,</hi> 1 Cor xv. 41. So the Glory of the Body of Christ, will be as the Glory of the Sun; and the Glory of the Bodies of his Children, like the Glory of the Stars, all shining in Brightness, Splendor and Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though not equally alike. When Christ appeared with <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> in the Transfiguration on the Mount, the Glory then on his Body is set forth, as in a Glass: <hi>His Face did shine as the Sun, and his Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was white as the Light,</hi> Mat. xvii. 2. So will the risen Bodies of the Saints be, shining brighter than the Sun, whiter than the purest Light. That, that is sown in Dishonour, as afore hinted, will be raised in Glory. They that are laid in the Earth, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>le Infants, will be raised in full growth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:51088:78"/>and perfect stature; they that be entombed decrepit, old and deformed, shall rise again well-shaped, vigorous and beautiful. They that drop to the Grave poor, tattered, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Slaves, shall come out from thence rich, free and illustrious, greater than Kings and Emperors: Then indeed in a literal sense the <hi>Eyes of the Blind shall be opened, the Ears of the Deaf be unloosned, the Lame shall leap as an Hart, and the Tongue of the Dumb shall sing for Joy,</hi> Isa. xxxv. 5, 6. &amp;c. For the Bodies of the risen Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers that are now wrapt up in Dishonour, shall be then cloathed with the highest Honour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Then weakness shall put on Strength; and that <hi>that is sown in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, shall be raised in power,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 43.</p>
                  <p>Then the Coward shall be valiant, and the Feeble exceeding strong; their Strength and Courage will be very near Angelick then. We read, that an Angel destroyed an hundred thousand in one Night; and how great, ineffably great, will be the Strength and Power of the spiritual Bodies of the risen Saints in that Day! But having spoke of this dispersedly afore under other Heads, I shall now add no more thereunto; nor mention several other Advantages that the Bodies of the Saints shall arise with, that I might insist on: For these are sufficient to evince, that Believers can triumph over the Grave in respect of their Bodies.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:51088:79"/>
                  <p> Thus having dispatch'd the Doctrinal part, I now proceed to the Application, which I briefly intend to finish in three or four Inferences: The two first will particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly relate to the last branch of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine: The two last will respect the whole Doctrine in general.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Infer.</hi> The first Inference is, for the Comfort of Believers against Death. If it be so that their dead Bodies can thus triumph over the Grave, what else is there in their Death that seems terrible? As for their Souls, they are then instantly lodged in the Mansions prepared for them above: But if their Bodies are thus also excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for, every thing in Death is to be contemned. Nor need we shrink at the Pangs that usually attend Death; they are but the Cracks of a tattered House, blown up in order to be rebuilt a stately Edifice; or rather a Groan or two at farewel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two parting Friends that have been long loving Companions together, but now must be separated for a great Season, that they might meet again to the greater ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of both, and these are the Body and the Soul. And Death is no less to be scorned coming by his terrible Messengers, Fire, Sword, Gibbets, Poison, or the like: When he uses Instruments, he is generally more courteous and gentle in his Dealings, and quicker of dispatch. A torrid malignant Fever, or a Torture of several Weeks or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:51088:79"/>Months by the Stone, Gout, or Strangury, have dealt more cruelly with a body in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving it, than the <hi>Spanish</hi> Rack, or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risian</hi> Wheel have done. So that consider Death in all its affrighting Circumstances, it need not be at all frightful to the dying Believer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Infer.</hi> The second Inference is, for the Comfort of Believers, against the tiresome fatigue of Pains, Sicknesses and Infirmities. The comfortable Consideration is this: That all Pains and Maladies prepare and hasten the Body for the place of refining; as they are Nature's Suffering, so they are the effect of Grace mellowing the whole Man for Glory: They in whom Grace shines most, are commonly most infirm in their Bodies; for the Souls that are most on the Wing for God, whose Graces are most vigorous in their Exercise, eat out soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess the Tenement of Clay. As the painful feeling of the Body of Death within, is the nailing of the old Man to the Cross by the new Creature, and Corruption painfully felt and odiously seen, is Corruption a mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; proved by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 5. where he calls the mortification of Sin, <hi>a being planted into the likeness of the Death of Christ;</hi> which was a painful and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as well as a cursed Death: <hi>v.</hi> 6. he calls <hi>it the crucifixion of the old Man,</hi> and the <hi>destruction of the Body of Sin;</hi> that of <hi>Galat.</hi> ii. 20. being added thereunto, and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:51088:80"/>compared with Rom. vii. from the 15th <hi>ver.</hi> to the end, particularly <hi>ver.</hi> 24. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 25. From all which places, 'tis evident, that the painful feeling of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and the Body of Death within, is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and the Body of Death crucified, and the dying Tyger roaring in the Soul. The inward Blows of that Nature we feel, are Stabs at Heart given to inbred Corruption by the second <hi>Adam:</hi> So the pains Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers feel in their Bodies are but as so many blows the second <hi>Adam</hi> gives there to the first, in order to drive him out, and take up the whole Room for himself. Comfort thy self then with these words, thou sick Believer, under thy tedious malady and and sore pains, or with such arguings as these: These Pangs indeed are sharp, but they will after yield peaceably and blessed Fruits, for 'tis in order that that which is earthly may be done away; that that which is spiritual may fill up all in all; 'tis for the refining of <hi>Flesh and Blood;</hi> for Flesh and Blood, as now circumstanced, <hi>cannot inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Corruption inherit Incorruption,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. 50. I will be patient under my greatest pains then, since their tendency is to eat out Corruption in my Body, so that it might inherit eternal Glory, together with my Soul in incorruption.</p>
                  <p>The other remaining Inferences relate to the whole Doctrine, as laid down in the first Sermon.</p>

If so be that a Believer can triumph over Death and the Grave, in reference to his Soul and Body, then the unspeakably free, rich, glorious Grace of God in Christ manifested in him, and believed into, must needs oblige the Man or Woman to all manner of holy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. When Men have said all they can, against the Doctrine of Free Grace, impiously branding it with the Names of Antinomianism and Licentiousness, yet this is undeniable from the experience of the most Godly, as well as from the Word of the Lord, that nothing constrains to all manner of holy Obedience, like the Love of Christ revealed to the Conscience, and the Love of the Father in his Love. All that are most Godly, can say what is said of the Woman in the Gospel; they weep much, and do much, as she, <hi>Luke</hi> vii. 44, 47. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they love much; and they love much, because much is frankly forgiven them. This is certain, that the inherent Holiness of the Soul, is the strength of the Soul, and the strength of the inward Sanctification of the Soul, depends upon looking to, by Faith, that Grace that is in Christ. <hi>Thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my Son, be strong within,</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>] 2. Tim. ii. 1, 5. in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus, <hi>viz.</hi> at God's right hand. 'Tis not said, Be strong in the Grace that is in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:51088:81"/>your selves, for that is to seek the living among the dead, a living Christ in our dead Frames, when he is never to be found there for <hi>he is risen,</hi> and ever lives at the Father's right Hand, to make intercession for his Children, and a constant steady look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him there, always interceeding, and still <hi>full of Grace and Truth;</hi> 'tis that will carry on the work of Sanctification in the Soul. The spiritual Life of a Believer is from Faith, and maintained by Faith. It is written, <hi>The Just shall live by Faith,</hi> Rom. i. 17. Gal. iii. 11. Heb. x. 38. Faith is said to <hi>purify the Heart,</hi> Acts xv. 9. <hi>to sanctify,</hi> viz. the whole Man, <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 18. and Faith always respects Christ and his Grace. The <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> i. e. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Grace in the <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Conscience by believing, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to <hi>purge the Conscience from dead Works to serve the living God,</hi> Heb. ix. 14. The <hi>Grace of God that bringeth Salvation, and hath appeared to all Men</hi> in the Gospel, but as revealed unto the Consciences of them, that believe, <hi>teaching them, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying ungodliness and worldly Lusts, they should live soberly righteously and godly in this present World,</hi> Tit. ii. 11, 12. And the God of all Grace in manifesting his Grace to the Soul, that he has called it to eternal Glory by Jesus Christ does go on to make perfect, establish, strengthen and settle the Soul: Which Expressions, comprehend all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:51088:81"/>the Work of Sanctification, in its several parts and degrees, till it <hi>arrives to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the stature of a perfect Man in Christ Jesus.</hi> 'Tis apparent from these and several other places of the holy Scriptures, that the Grace that is in us, proportionably, rises and falls to the believing Views we have of the Grace that is in the Heart of Christ towards us, and in the Hand of Christ to give us. To draw towards a close in this matter: This is it I aim at, that our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Righteousness within us, is begun and carried on by Faith in the imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Christ without us: These two are every way distinct, yet so as the former still flows from the latter. The All-wise God has so ordered it in the dispensation of his Grace, that his free Grace shall be magnified, and the Righteousness of his Son highly valued and advanced. Were the only use of Christ's Righteousness (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that is a great use of it) to secure eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory for us, we should be tempted to have little recourse to it by Faith; for that being once done, and our state secured, corrupt nature would be apt to insinuate to us there would be no great need of such frequent viewing that God-like Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness without us, wherein we stand, it being that that is so contrary to Flesh and Blood. But now our Holiness in every step of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Righteousness of Christ being apprehended by the Soul in believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51088:82"/>it must, or it ought, to necessitate us to have constant recourse, by continued Acts of believing to this glorious Righteousness all the day long. Since it is thus, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dram of true Gospel-Holiness flows into the Soul only this way: The Apostle affirms it three times, That <hi>now the Just shall live by Faith;</hi> which Life, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, he means to be a Life spiritual, or Life of Holiness here. And 'tis necessary that the Work of Holiness be carried on continually and constantly; and therefore that we believe in Christ and his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness always. The reason of all is this: The Lord will have the Righteousness which is of Faith, the imputed Righteousness of his Son always viewed, believed in, and admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us. So that hence you may believe the Doctrine of Free-Grace does not tend to Licentiousness (as Satan in various Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments clamours against it) but the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Such undeserved super-abounding Grace to pardoned Sinners, being the main motive unto Holiness of Heart, Lip and Life. The Apostle plainly affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 14. That the Souls being brought under Grace, breaks Sin's Dominion therein, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Soul being brought in believing under the powerful influence of that <hi>Grace that Reigns through Righteousness unto eternal Life, by Jesus Christ our Lord,</hi> Rom. v. 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Infer.</hi> The second and last use is, for the encouragement of Sinners; yea, the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:51088:82"/>chiefest worst and vilest to come to Christ from the glorious Grace that is held forth in the Doctrine. The Believers, that thus have, and can triumph over Death and the Grave, were once Sinners as you; may be some of them as vile as the vilest of you. Come you, therefore, and tast and see how gracious our Lord the Redeemer is, <hi>Come you and join with us in a perpetual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to serve the Lord.</hi> Accept of the peace of the Gospel, and make a venture upon an offered Jesus: Oh come you, the worst of you, and live the life of Faith like the Just, and you shall die the Death of the Righteous, to triumph over all in Death. Whatever your Objections can be, this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing Free-Grace can answer them all. Infinite Wisdom has permitted all along prodigious Mountains of Opposition to rise in the way of Grace, on purpose that that Grace of God may declare itself boundless by triumphing over all. Thus tho' it was designed from all Eternity, that free Grace should have all the Honour in making the Elect happy: Yet a Law for Life was set up, that through the Breaches thereof, Sin might be suffered to enter; Sin, that odious thing that was such an affront to the whole Godhead, and brought so great an eclipse on his manifest Glory, was suffered, I say, to enter, that electing Grace might be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in mounting above it. <hi>And the Law entered once again on Mount Sinai, that so
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:51088:83"/>Sin might abound,</hi> on purpose that Free Grace, might super-abound, and reign and triumph over all. Free-Grace and electing Love does not only, like <hi>Jordan,</hi> overflow all its Banks, but like the mighty Deluge, cover the tops of the highest Mountains of Opposition in the World. Therefore what Objections, O Sinners, can you have against bowing down to the Grace offered in the Gospel. O harden not your Hearts, but <hi>now hear ye his Voice?</hi> Know assuredly this, That objecting against your acceptance of the Grace of Christ (be your Objections ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so specious) is no other but a gain saying of Christ. O do not rebel and gainsay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wide opened and stretch'd forth Arms of eternal Mercy and Compassion that now is extended to you. Be thou the vilest on the face of the Earth, yet as vile as thou has obtained Mercy. There are on Record instances of Sovereign Grace, greater than any of you can be: What think you of <hi>Adam?</hi> I durst almost engage to answer all thine Objections thou vilest Sinner, from that single Precedent. You say you are the greatest of Sinners; you cannot be greater than he, who was the Arch-Rebel and Traytor, who led his whole Race into an horrid Rebellion against God, yet he found Mercy. Ay, but your Sins are great; not greater than his, who, in one Sin, was guilty of the highest Ingratitude, the most mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Unbelief, and the most devilish Pride
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:51088:83"/>and Discontent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> besides his breaking the whole Moral Law in that one Sin. Yet you may say, My Sins are many. I answer, That first Sin of his was a pregnant Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, millions of Legions in it. But you'll reply, I sinned against Knowledge: So did he, against the most perfect Knowledge of God and his Will; yes, and against the most perfect enjoyment of God too; that is more than you can do. But you will object, I have sinned grievously. I reply, <hi>Adam</hi> was reek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot in his deep-dy'd Iniquity, when Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy stepped in. True, say you, but I have shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Mercy: So did he, when he fled to hide himself in the Garden. But you may again object, I have extenuated mine heinous Sins, instead of abhorring myself for them. Indeed you have done ill; yet though thou hast done as evil as thou couldst, yet do not let that discourage thee from accepting of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Mercy; which to refuse is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Sin of all: So did he, and charged God with it too. <hi>The Woman thou gavest me,</hi> &amp;c. yet he found Mercy; and why not you? Many other things of this nature might be added, but that I am now bound to the greatest brevity. What shall I add, the case of <hi>Paul,</hi> who was an injurious Person, a Persecutor and a Blaspemer, yet he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Mercy; or the case of <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalene,</hi> who had seven Devils; of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the Woman mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Luke</hi> 7. &amp;c. who were all three noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:51088:84"/>Sinners, yet Sovereign Grace was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them. Let me add but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance more, and that is fresh in your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories; the case of Mr. <hi>Bigg,</hi> whose late decease gives the occasion to this Discourse, and the present Solemnity. His Death-bed attended with the manifestation of such So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of Grace and Power from above, has alarmed the Neighbourhood. And you seem all to be in a surprize, and at a gaze about the things you have seen and heard relating thereunto: I shall therefore give as an exact account of the whole as has come into my Hands, that though he be dead, he may yet speak to you. And tho' in the Account I shall give, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to touch upon his former Life, yet it shall be done with a favourable Hand, only so much as may tend to the advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that glorious Free-Grace manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards him: But ere I begin, I must antidote my Hearers with this Caution; because it pleased the Lord to magnifie his glorious Grace towards him on his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that none of you dare to presume from thence to put off your coming to Christ till a Death-bed season. 'Tis not, defer Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving till a dying Time. I durst almost venture to say, That whoever encourage themselves to continue in ways of Impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from this example, have breaking forth upon them the black Marks and Tokens of final Rejection. It was well observed by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:51088:84"/>one, one Thief on the Cross, in his dying Moments, obtained Grace, that none might despair; and but one, that none might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume: So but one Mr. <hi>Bigg</hi> perhaps in an Age, that none may think when they have lived all their Life time, to Sin, they shall with ease, and at pleasure, die to Christ. Thus having given this Caution, I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to my Narrative.</p>

                  <head>A NARRATIVE OF Mr. <hi>BIGGS's</hi> Conversion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>MR. <hi>Bigg,</hi> when married to worthy Mr. <hi>Browning</hi>'s Daughter, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sober and well enclined, and by some, thought to be Godly. But it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in some time after, the Work was but outward; for being led aside by vain Company, and being at first (as it was thought, and he expressed it to some) filled with dreadful Horrors for it, he fell into a woful Security, and continued hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Sin, especially that of Company-keeping for several Years. At last he was surprized with a lingring Distemper, that brought him nigh to the Gates of Death; during which time, he continued stupid and unconcerned about his Soul; but it pleased the Lord that then he recovered, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51088:85"/>well for about two Years, or above; but then fell into a dangerous Relapse, and then there appeared, pretty early in him, some Concernment about his Soul, though he kept it very secret; as indeed he was by Nature reserved, close, and of few Words, except he was amongst his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and distempered in his Head. The first time he was seen to be apparently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, was upon this following Occasion: It has pleased the all-wise God, whose ways are in the Deep, and whose Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are past finding out, to lay his heavy Hand upon a Child of his, of twelve years of Age, (who is known to be very gracious) in that strange and unusual Distemper that hath seized many others; which Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God towards us, makes us to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up into the Mouths of Talkers, and to be gazed and wondred at by many, who pass their Censures variously, as they are disposed. Though we desire humbly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesce in the Will of the Lord, waiting for his Salvation, not in the least questioning, but he will eminently glorify himself in the Issue, as he has already in some Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, blessed be his Name, and then they that have reproached us, shall see, and hear, and be ashamed. The Distemper afflicting the Child with Light-headedness, (the first Effect of it in that kind, as was observed on her) she talked of divers things, and amongst the rest, of what good People
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:51088:86"/>there were in the Neighbourhood that she loved; and amongst the rest, she said her Mother was good, and would go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; but being asked concerning her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether she thought her Father would go to Heaven; she replied, she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired he might: Hereupon Mr. <hi>Bigg</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, and she again in his Presence asked, what she said of her Father? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, says the Child, very gravely and awfully, but that I wish his eternal Good! which Words fell upon him with such Power and Weight, that it cast him into great Passion of Weeping for some time. About that time, being very restless in the Night, said to his dear Relation, he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have something: It was answered (supposing he meant Physick) that nothing would do him more good than a little Sleep. He replied, yes, a little Hope would do me more good. It was told him, true! a little good Hope through Grace, would do you more good Indeed. Remember that Place of Scripture, <hi>Isa.</hi> xlv. 22. <hi>Look unto me and be saved, all the ends of the Earth? For I am God, and there is none else.</hi> He presently answered, That was not so easily done, and then continued, These Words have run in my Mind of late to terrifie me; <hi>Because I have called, and you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, &amp;c.</hi> And many dreadful Scriptures altogether. Then he was told, That Christ was able to save to the uttermost. Yes, said
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51088:86"/>he, and able to destroy to the uttermost too. Then he ended (speaking nothing of Soul Matters, but what the Force of Terror one while, and Joy another while made him. Some time after he was again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining; which, whilst he was doing, he was acquainted, That his Condition was hopeful, though painful: It being added, Time was, when you have been under God's Hand, and in great Danger, and to my Apprehension, was Stupid and Sottish. He answered, Yes, it was so. Then being asked, if he had not some Hope? he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that sometimes he was ready to think that if God had had a Purpose to destroy him, he would have done it before now. Nor long after, as he was going to Bed one Night, he asked one, what she thought of him, as to his Living? she answer'd, she did not know what the Lord would do with him: As to Sense, you are not like to be long in this World (he then being very weak.) And must I die then? said he: Oh, I dare not die! I dare not die! Oh! 'tis an awful thing to die, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some short time after, whilst he was in his bitter Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, several Scriptures were laid afore him to encourage his Believing into Christ. He said, right! if it had been in time; but it is too late now. He was answered, it was not too late, seeing the Lord had opened his Eyes on this side of the Grave, and made him see his Need of Christ. He
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51088:87"/>said, yes, it is too late; for I have had the proffer of Christ, and the same Tenders of Salvation with others. And I would not have Christ then, and therefore it is just with God to deny him to me now. But one added, you can justifie God under all. Oh! Ay, said he: Oh! Ay. He that hath born so many years Provocations at my Hands — I will speak well of him as long as I live, however he deals with me. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time he desired that Scripture might be turned to, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 12. <hi>That I may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that for, which also I am appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended of Christ.</hi> Methinks, said he, it bears this Sense: That Christ must first take hold of the Soul, before the Soul can take hold of Christ. A little before he kept his Bed, he said to his Wife: Dear, What must I do; There is no way for me but to close with Jesus Christ, and I cannot do it, I cannot do it. I do not know either whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am willing to be saved by Christ or no. May be, if I should recover, things would wear off. Oh! I dread the Thoughts of it. If I may but live till I have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mercy, I shall think I have lived long enough. But Oh! the Thoughts how few find Mercy at last, would make any ones Heart to ake. It being on the Heart of his dear Relation to send to the Church of Christ at <hi>Rothwell,</hi> to pray for him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him with it; asking him, if it was not his Desire also. He answered, he
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:51088:87"/>thought of it some Days afore, but durst not be so bold as to mention such a thing; but did desire they should seek the Lord for him, that he might close savingly with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and have a true Godly Sorrow and Repentance, never to be repented of. Now we are drawing towards the close of his Life. The Friday before he departed, he could scarce rise, being exceeding weak; but he began to be very earnest about his Soul. He spake thus to Mrs. <hi>Bigg,</hi> The Prayers of God's People are a great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to me; I always had a great Esteem of the Prayers of God's People. That Night he was confined to his Bed; when he was laid in it, he said very awfully, I shall rise no more till the Trumpet sounds. When in Bed, he was complaining of the greatness of his Sins; he was taken up by one, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whether he thought his Sins so great, as that there was not enough in Christ to pardon? No, says he, I will not reflect such Dishonour on the blood of Christ, as to think so. I know there is an effectual Plaister prepared; but if not applied, what then; A little after he brake forth into this Expression, As there is a fulness of Sin in me, so there is much more Fulness in Christ to Pardon. However that Night he continued very restless, his Distress be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such, he could scarcely lay his Eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And in the Morning (which was Saturday) he spoke in great Agony, I must
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:51088:88"/>die, and have not the least bit of Hope. Being then advised to venture on Christ, and cast himself upon him, as one able to save to the uttermost: He with a Countenance, that witnessed huge inward Grief, replied, it was too late. His dear Relation answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him thus, It is not too late. God has opened your Eyes on this side the Grave, and made you see your need of Christ; therefore 'tis not too late; but he calleth you now. He presently spake thus, Shall I venture then upon Christ? It was answered him, He must. Then having paused, his Countenance more composed and cheary, he spoke resolvedly, I can but perish — then stopped. Then his dear Wife observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Words and Countenance, said, Hope is a Dawning. He quickly replied, I hope it is, and soon after burst forth into high Acclamations and Expressions of spiritual Joy, and Admirations of the free Grace of God as Strength would permit. But he was much afflicted, that he had not Strength nor Breath to speak of God's free Grace to him, that the World might know what God had done for him. Notwithstanding he spake somewhat to this effect: It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles me that God should loose his Glory, who hath not, I hope, suffered me to loose my Soul. Oh, that I had Breath to speak of Christ! Methinks I could speak of Christ till Night. I think I could speak of Christ <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Year together! And indeed all that Day,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:51088:88"/>when he had strength to speak, it was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently of Christ: And once fetching his Breath with much Difficulty, he said, I shall breath out my last Breath with a blessed be God for Jesus Christ; and a little afterwards he would complain, that he could love Christ no more. That day there came a young Gentleman, an Acquaintance of his, to visit him, who found him very weak; but when he had recovered a little Strength, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed himself to him thus: All that we have to do for God and our Soul's Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be done here: There is nothing to be done in the Grave, and it is my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and my dying Counsel to all young Men, that they labour to make sure of Christ in a time of Health, and not put off so great a Work as I have done.</p>
                  <p>The following Day, which was the Lord's Day, he was exceeding weak, and pained in his Body, and variously exercised in his Soul, as appears by several Expressions that dropt from him at times. Whilst he was complaining of his Illness, he was told, that however it was, yet God is good. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, You shall never hear me say other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, sink or swim, saved or be damned, I will justifie him. A little after, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in his Soul, he cryed out, How hard a thing it is to croud through the Throng of Sin and Guilt to Jesus Christ: Sure Christ will not accept of such a filthy thing as I: But said he again, God's End in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51088:89"/>and saving Sinners, is to glorify his own free Grace; and then why not towards me as well as another? What a wonderful Word is that? A Man may die with that Word in his Mouth, <hi>The free Gift is of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Offences unto Justification.</hi> Then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, And though my Flesh and my Heart faileth, <hi>God is the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever.</hi> Another time, being somewhat clouded, and speaking of the Grace of God, I cannot demand it, nor have I deserved it: But being asked, if he would not accept of it: Yes, replied, he very thankfully. Towards Night he grew more distressed, for several Friends being gathered about him he looked upon them dolefully, and said, Oh, I tremble! being asked at what? he answered, at the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Perishing. One then sitting by, that knew how it was with him, told him it was impossible, he being helped through Grace to commit his Soul into such Hands. It was said further, <hi>None can pull you out of his Hands.</hi> He speaks a little after, Poor Hearts, you are willing to hope the best; I wish you are not mistaken. You know, said he, to his Wife, Dear, oppressed Nature will cry out for Relief; but being answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that oppressed Nature could not rest on Christ for Salvation; or to this Effect, he was filent. Next Morning he was much <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>omplaining that he was to die, and do Christ no Service in the World. He cryed
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51088:89"/>out, Oh, that I might live but one Year! but may be if I should, I would be wicked: But yet, said he, I think verily, if I know my Heart, I am willing to imbrace Christ on his own Terms; I think verily, if I was to live the strictest Life as ever Saint lived, yet I think I could embrace none but Christ. A little after, being full of Complaints as to his Soul, it was told him, Yesterday you could say, though my Heart and my flesh faileth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He answered, But I cannot-say so to Day. Some time after, his Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to mount up, and being melted under the sense of God's Grace to him, he said, If I had strength, I would soon make my Confession Town-Talk. I need not tell the Town what my Life hath been; they know that very well: But I would have them know the difference between them that have Grace and them that have none. <hi>Monday</hi> about Noon Mr. <hi>Bear,</hi> came to visit him, and asked him, What art thou going now to Christ? He answered, Better now than ever. But he was so weak, and laboured with such Difficulty of Breathing, that he could scarce speak; which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed himself, saying, That if it were to save his Life, he could not speak; yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Mr. <hi>Bear,</hi> that he would wrestle and strive with God in Prayer for him, that he might be helped sincerely to close with Christ. A little after, finding his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness increase upon him, he spake thus, I am brought to the Dust of Death. That Night,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51088:90"/>which was the Night before he departed, about nine a Clock, he grew weaker and weaker, and fetch'd his Breath shorter and shorter: Being a little lifted up on his Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, he lifted up his Hands, and bad all farewell. After which, he drew his Breath as one just departing; being (as 'twas thought) past speaking, was spoke to by a Friend thus, putting him in mind of his own Expression, Blessed be God for Jesus Christ; whereat he was heard to say soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Amen.</hi> Then his dear Relation added, Christ the Fore-runner is for thee entred: Then he, with a pleasant Countenance, nodded his Head, being not able to speak. And now Death indeed was in his Face in all its Symptoms, and all concluded him just a dying; when, all of a sudden, his Blood returned in his Face, Vigour and Liveliness into his opened Eyes, and with a Voice exceeding loud, as if he had rose from the Dead on purpose to give in his dying Testimony for free Grace, he thus spake triumphantly. I know that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liveth, and that with these Eyes I shall see him, and not anothers: <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly; Come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, come quickly; Come Lord Jesus, come quickly:</hi> These Words he spake with such Vehemence, that he made the whole House to eccho, when afore he could scarce be heard if one laid his Ear to his Mouth, and then continued thus with no less Accent and Affection, I am no more afraid to die, than
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51088:90"/>I am to shut my Eyes: I am no more afraid to die than I am to go to sleep. God loves me dearly, and I love God dearly: I am sure he will do me no hurt. Lord, strike the Blow, and the Work is done, I long to be gone, I long to see Jesus Christ. O that all the Town might ring of God's free Grace to me! What, at the last Hour too? Who would have thought of this a few Weeks ago? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing less than an Eternity is sufficient to admire free Grace: This is blessed work indeed: This is Dying indeed. Thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, said he, turning to his Wife, will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to see me in Heaven: He little thinks I am so near him. His Wife asked him, if he thought she should ever come where he was going. He answered, I do not ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it; thou, nor thy poor Children nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Through God's Grace, his dying Prophesie is in a likely way to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in all of them. You will not be long after me. Come, one Bosom will hold us all: He that hath begun the good Work in them (meaning his Children) will carry it on till the Day of Jesus Christ. A Friend hearing him speak so heartily, said, Sir, I hope you may live still. He replied. Oh do not tell me so! I do not love to hear of that Ear: I would not come back again for thousands of Gold and Silver; but what the Lord will, I am wholly swallowed up in God's Sovereign Will. After he was spent with speaking, he said, I can speak no more; I hope you are all satisfied. Fare
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:51088:91"/>you well, expecting (as it seems) he should have gone immediately to Heaven. But it pleased the Lord to order it otherwise, and to continue him 'till the next Night, though under some Regret, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently added, Oh! I thought I had been going so sweetly, but I am here still; and next Morning, hearing some Friends dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing about the Distress he had been in, he said to them, but the Lord has now ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly satisfied me. Yet by reason his Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was delayed, it occasioned further Temptation, and a black Cloud arose upon his Soul after all this glorious Sun-shine. He burst out into such bitter Expressions as these: God has forsaken me, and I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid 'tis a fore Judgment of God upon me, that I lie in such a Condition. I am afraid, least I have deceived myself with false Hopes. Some time after the beginning of his Distress, there appeared on him Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive Fits: whereupon he said to his Wife, I have Fits. She answered, I am afraid you have, He added, I am almost frighted out of my Wits. Being asked at what: He replied, At the awfulness of Death. This Conflict lasted for some time; but the Lord was pleased to return again, as was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for his Soul was composed and still. His Fits ceased, though his Strength was gone, that he could speak but little. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this for Satisfaction was had from him a little before he departed. He said, would I was up! His Wife answered, That
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51088:91"/>would be a pleasant Sight indeed to see thee up again, to tell us what thou hast seen on this sick Bed. He answered, I have seen that here, which hath made my Heart, and the Hearts of many more glad. It was then told him, you may see now what Satan's Temptations are, when God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits him, he will rob a Child of God, of his Comforts; but that is all he can do. And it is a great All too, said he, it was that which made my Life a Burthen to me Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked, if he did not believe he should have Comfort again. He answered, Yes, but did not know when. But it was not long before he had it to the full; for now he fell into a sweet Sleep, the best he had for many Days; in which Sleep he quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by slept in Jesus.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you an Account of some of his Death-bed Experiences, in whom; though now dead, he yet speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to you the Living, and invites you all to partake of the same Grace with him, that you may enter into the same Glory he now is in. Have a care, as I cautioned you afore, to suck Poison to the Ruin of your own Souls out of this Instance of God's Free, Rich, and Glorious Grace; but make this Improvement of it, to stir you up now to accept of, and venture on the boundless Grace of God in Christ Jesus. <hi>Consider what has been said, and the Lord give you Understanding in all things.</hi>
